<T1>Jokesters, advertisers pounce on Super Bowl power outage - CNN.com</T1>
<T1.1>Call it the Super Bowl MVP -- the most valuable power outage.</T1.1>
<T1.1.1>For 35 bewildering minutes Sunday night, the Super Bowl showdown between the Baltimore Ravens and the San Francisco 49ers ground to a halt when half of the lights in the New Orleans Superdome went out.</T1.1.1>
<T1.1.1.1>Players stretched on the field.</T1.1.1.1>
<T1.1.1.2>The more than 71,000 fans in attendance did the wave.</T1.1.1.2>
<T1.1.1.3>And with no immediate explanation for the outage, social media lit up.</T1.1.1.3>
<T1.1.2>"The worst part about this power outage is that people at parties were forced to talk to each other," Fortune Feimster, a writer for the E! show "Chelsea Lately," tweeted.</T1.1.2>
The brand bowl
<T1.2>Within four minutes of the outage, advertisers had sent out their first tweets.</T1.2>
<T1.2.1>The funniest tweets of the Super Bowl</T1.2.1>
<T1.2.1.1>Nabisco's Oreo cookie was among the first to jump on the Twitter brandwagon, with an ad featuring the cookie on a partially blacked out page.</T1.2.1.1>
<T1.2.1.2>The people behind Tide laundry detergent went up with a Twitter ad that read: "We can't get your #blackout, but we can get your stains out.#SuperBowl #TidePower."</T1.2.1.2>
<T1.2.1.3>Even Audi took a swipe at its competitor, tweeting that it was sending "LED lights" over to the dome, whose official name is the Mercedes-Benz Superdome.</T1.2.1.3>
<T1.2.2>In fact, the outage was the No. 1 Twitter-related moment of the Super Bowl, generating 231,000 tweets per minute.</T1.2.2>
<T1.3>The second big moment?</T1.3>
<T1.3.1>The 108-yard kickoff return for a touchdown by Baltimore Ravens Jacoby Jones.</T1.3.1>
<T1.3.1.1>But even that only generated merely 185,000 tweets per minute, according to the site.</T1.3.1.1> 
<T1.4>The power company said it wasn't to blame, and stadium officials apologized but said little else until well after the game.</T1.4>
<T1.4.1>And then, in a statement hours later, Superdome officials said a piece of equipment designed to monitor the electrical load "sensed an abnormality in the system."</T1.4.1>
<T1.4.1.1>It still isn't clear what the "abnormality" was -- but more than a few people had their own suspicions.</T1.4.1.1>
<T1.4.1.1.1>A majority on social media blamed it on the fans of the 49ers, who were trailing 28-to-6 in the third quarter before the blackout.</T1.4.1.1.1>
<T1.4.1.1.2>Photos began quickly showing up on Flickr, Twitter and Facebook of the so-called hands of a 49ers' fan reaching into electrical power box to turn off the power, with the words: "They not winning that easy."</T1.4.1.1.2>
<T1.4.1.2>If the 49ers win after this, you all know who's to blame.</T1.4.1.2>
<T1.4.2>After the power was restored, the 49ers scored three times in just four minutes. Then again, maybe not.</T1.4.2>
<T1.4.2.1>"Whatever.Who hasn't blacked out in New Orleans," one person said on Twitter.</T1.4.2.1>
<T1.5>Or in San Francisco, for that matter.</T1.5>
<T1.5.1>In December 2011, the lights went out twice during the same game at Candlestick Park.</T1.5.1>
<T1.5.1.1>The 49ers won that game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, 20-3.</T1.5.1.1>
<T1.5.1.2>Some said it was the curse of the Superdome -- despite hosting seven Super Bowl games and its more than $300 million renovation following Hurricane Katrina.</T1.5.1.1>
<T1.5.1.2>Some on Twitter and Facebook joked Saints quarterback Drew Brees was responsible, pulling the power plug to get even for the team failing to make football's big show.</T1.5.1.2>
<T1.5.1.3>Then there were those who pointed to Bane, the villain in the Batman movie "The Dark Night Rises."In the movie, Bane mines a football field in Pittsburgh that explodes after a great scoring run by Steeler Hines Ward."</T1.5.1.3>
 <T1.6>Beyonce's wattage</T1.6>
<T1.6.1>The general consensus on social media appeared to be that Beyonce's high-wattage half-time performance was mostly likely to blame for the blackout.</T1.6.1>
<T1.6.1.1>"Beyonce blew the fuse!Genius!" tweeted singer Adam Lambert.</T1.6.1.1> 
<T1.6.2>In the end, the Ravens may have won Superbowl XLVII in New Orleans.</T1.6.2>
<T1.6.3>But the power outage won its social media time slot.</T1.6.3>
