<T1>Reconstructing the trail of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's deleted Instagram account - CNN.com</T1>
<T1.1>Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's Twitter account and VK Russian social networking profile have drawn heavy public scrutiny, but he left another, more hidden social media trail: a deleted Instagram account that sources close to him tell CNN once belonged to the accused Boston bomber.</T1.1>
<T1.1.1>The Instagram account, with the user name "jmaister1," no longer exists, and friends of Tsarnaev's say it was deleted only recently.</T1.1.1>
<T1.1.1.1>An Instagram spokesman declined to comment on the account or disclose when the account was deleted.</T1.1.1.1>
<T1.1.1.2>CNN National Security Analyst Juliette Kayyem says the account could be significant.</T1.1.1.2>
<T1.1.1.2.1>"If I were an investigator right now, obviously the platform he deleted matters the most," she said.</T1.1.1.2.1>
<T1.1.2>Traces of the jmaister1 account were still visible this week in Google's Web cache and on other archiving sites.</T1.1.2>
<T1.1.2.1>Digital sleuths often use those tools to find glimpses of deleted material.</T1.1.2.1>
<T1.1.2.2>When oversharing online can get you arrested</T1.1.2.2>
<T1.1.2.2.1>"It's exactly like an archive," tech entrepreneur and programmer Sam Altman explained.</T1.1.2.2.1>
<T1.1.3>Google's cache stores the pages it indexes for variable lengths of time: sometimes days, sometimes weeks.</T1.1.3>
<T1.1.3.1>The digital traces that remain show that Tsarnaev added a "like" on several photos referring to Chechnya that were posted by other Instagram users.</T1.1.3.1>
<T1.1.3.1.1>One shows Chechen warlord Shamil Basayev, a onetime government official who later masterminded terrorist attacks against Russia.</T1.1.3.1.1>
<T1.1.3.1.2>Basayev was killed in 2006.</T1.1.3.1.2>
<T1.1.4>Another pro-Chechnya image that Tsarnaev "liked" carries a string of hashtags including #FreeChechenia #Jihad #Jannah #ALLAH #Jesus and #God.</T1.1.4>
<T1.1.4.1>An academic Chechnya expert whom CNN consulted said the images illustrated a familiarity with Chechen politics and iconography.</T1.1.4.1>
<T1.1.4.2>Tsarnaev's Instagram account wasn't widely known; CNN spoke with several friends of his who said they were unaware of its existence.</T1.1.4.2>
<T1.1.4.2.1>Two of his high-school classmates, however, spoke about the account and said he used it to keep in touch with a close-knit group of school friends.</T1.1.4.2.1>
<T1.1.4.3>Since Tsarnaev's account was deleted, little of what he wrote and posted remains publicly visible, but Kayyem expects investigators to take a closer look at whatever data they can reconstruct.</T1.1.4.3>
<T1.2>Instagram makes clear in its terms of service that it will turn its records over to law enforcement officials when it receives a valid subpoena or search warrant.</T1.2>
<T1.2.1>"Given the volume of real-time content on Instagram, some information may only be stored for a short period of time," Instagram says on its site.</T1.2.1>
<T1.2.2>"We do not retain data for law enforcement purposes unless we receive a valid preservation request." Dead Boston bomb suspect posted video of jihadist, analysis shows</T1.2.2>
