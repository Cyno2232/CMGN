<T1>Scammers create fake donation websites for Sandy victims - CNN.com</T1>
<T1.1>As the Northeast digs out from a second major storm in little more than a week, experts say Internet scam artists are preying on generous Americans who want to donate to the victims of Superstorm Sandy.</T1.1>
<T1.1.1>According to a Maryland-based Internet watchdog company, more than 1,000 Internet domain sites with the words "Sandy" or "relief" were registered either as the storm was approaching the Caribbean last week or, in some cases, even before the hurricane hit.</T1.1.1>
<T1.1.1.1>Many of these types of domain sites are registered as soon as the National Weather Service announces the names of forthcoming hurricanes in the late spring, Ulrich explained.</T1.1.1.1>
<T1.1.1.2>Some of these websites were created by construction companies, lawyers or repair companies for potential business opportunities.</T1.1.1.2>
<T1.1.1.3>Others are more questionable.</T1.1.1.3>
<T1.1.2>CNN checked with the secretary of state's office in North Carolina, where the law requires charities to register.</T1.1.2>
<T1.1.2.1>The site does not show up.</T1.1.2.1>
<T1.2>Other Internet sites serve as an aggregate location for individuals to ask for money for themselves or their businesses.</T1.2>
<T1.2.1>Indiegogo, an international crowd funding site, has more than 32 pages of pleas for cash donations from Sandy victims.</T1.2.1>
<T1.2.1.1>One woman wrote that she needed money because "We left the city and headed south towards family in Pennsylvania.</T1.2.1.1>
<T1.2.1.2>CNN checked on that one as well but there was no information to prove or disprove the woman's posting.</T1.2.1.2>
<T1.2.2>Art Taylor, president of the Better Business Bureau's Wise Giving Alliance, says 70% of Americans donate money without ever really checking to find out where their money goes.</T1.2.2>
<T1.2.3>Earlier this week, the FBI took time to issue a public warning about scam artists in the wake of devastating storms.</T1.2.3>
<T1.3>On Tuesday, hundreds lined up at a Newark, New Jersey, church to receive food, water, blankets and cleaning supplies donated by Missouri-based Convoy of Hope.</T1.3>
<T1.3.1>Speaking of charities in general, a spokesman for Convoy of Hope said his organization was well aware that both individuals and even organizations sometimes prey on donors.</T1.3.1>
<T1.3.1.1>"There are going to be others out there that do things wrong, that do things for the wrong reason," Jeff Nene said.</T1.3.1.1>
<T1.3.1.2>"But when you go in with the right heart in the first place, everything works out."</T1.3.1.2>
<T1.4>The American Red Cross, the largest national charity dealing with the effects of Sandy has raised $103 million so far for Sandy victims, and that contributions "continue to pour in," according to spokeswoman Anne Marie Borrego.</T1.4>
<T1.4.1>She said all of those funds are earmarked for dealing with the victims of Sandy.</T1.4.1>
