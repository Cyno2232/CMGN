<T1>Obama urges military action against Syria but will seek Congress' OK </T1>
<T1.1>It's official: U.S. President Barack Obama wants lawmakers to weigh in on whether to use military force in Syria.</T1.1>
<T1.1.1>It's a step that is set to turn an international crisis into a fierce domestic political battle.</T1.1.1>
<T1.1.2>There are key questions looming over the debate</T1.1.2>
<T1.1.3>The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will hold a hearing over the matter on Tuesday, Sen. Robert Menendez said.</T1.1.3>
<T1.2>U.N. inspectors leave Syria</T1.2>
<T1.2.1>Obama's remarks came shortly after U.N. inspectors left Syria, carrying evidence that will determine whether chemical weapons were used in an attack early last week in a Damascus suburb.</T1.2.1>
<T1.2.1.1>British and U.S. intelligence reports say the attack involved chemical weapons, but U.N. officials have stressed the importance of waiting for an official report from inspectors.</T1.2.1.1>
<T1.2.2>The inspectors will share their findings with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon Ban, who has said he wants to wait until the U.N. team's final report is completed before presenting it to the U.N. Security Council.</T1.2.2>
 <T1.2.2.1>"It needs time to be able to analyze the information and the samples," Nesirky said.</T1.2.2.1>
<T1.2.2.2>He noted that Ban has repeatedly said there is no alternative to a political solution to the crisis in Syria, and that "a military solution is not an option."</T1.2.2.2>
 <T1.3>Obama: 'This menace must be confronted'</T1.3>
<T1.3.1>Obama's senior advisers have debated the next steps to take, and the president's comments Saturday came amid mounting political pressure over the situation in Syria.</T1.3.1>
<T1.3.1.1>Some U.S. lawmakers have called for immediate action while others warn of stepping into what could become a quagmire.</T1.3.1.1>
<T1.3.1.2>Some global leaders have expressed support, but the British Parliament's vote against military action earlier this week was a blow to Obama's hopes of getting strong backing from key NATO allies.</T1.3.1.2>
<T1.3.2>On Saturday, Obama proposed what he said would be a limited military action against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.</T1.3.2>
<T1.3.3>He spoke by phone with French President Francois Hollande before his Rose Garden speech.</T1.3.3>
<T1.3.3.1>"The two leaders agreed that the international community must deliver a resolute message to the Assad regime -- and others who would consider using chemical weapons -- that these crimes are unacceptable and those who violate this international norm will be held accountable by the world," the White House said.</T1.3.3.1>
<T1.3.4>A senior administration official told CNN that Obama has the authority to act without Congress -- even if Congress rejects his request for authorization to use force.</T1.3.4>
<T1.3.4.1>Meanwhile, as uncertainty loomed over how Congress would weigh in, U.S. military officials said they remained at the ready.</T1.3.4.1>
<T1.3.5>More than 160 legislators, including 63 of Obama's fellow Democrats, had signed letters calling for either a vote or at least a "full debate" before any U.S. action.</T1.3.5>
<T1.3.6>British Prime Minister David Cameron, whose own attempt to get lawmakers in his country to support military action in Syria failed earlier this week, responded to Obama's speech in a Twitter post Saturday.</T1.3.6>
<T1.3.7>An influential lawmaker in Russia -- which has stood by Syria and criticized the United States -- had his own theory.</T1.3.7>
<T1.3.8>In the United States, scattered groups of anti-war protesters around the country took to the streets Saturday.</T1.3.8>
<T1.4>What do Syria's neighbors think?</T1.4>
<T1.4.1>Why Russia, China, Iran stand by Assad Syria's government unfazed</T1.4.1>
<T1.4.1.1>After Obama's speech, a military and political analyst on Syrian state TV said Obama is "embarrassed" that Russia opposes military action against Syria, is "crying for help" for someone to come to his rescue and is facing two defeats -- on the political and military levels.</T1.4.1.1>
<T1.4.1.2>Syria's prime minister appeared unfazed by the saber-rattling.</T1.4.1.2>
<T1.4.2>The Syrian government has denied that it used chemical weapons in the August 21 attack, saying that jihadists fighting with the rebels used them in an effort to turn global sentiments against it.</T1.4.2>
<T1.4.2.1>British intelligence had put the number of people killed in the attack at more than 350.</T1.4.2.1>
<T1.4.2.2>On Saturday, Obama said "all told, well over 1,000 people were murdered.</T1.4.2.2>"
