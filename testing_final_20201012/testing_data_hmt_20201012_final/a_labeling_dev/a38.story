<T1>Luxor balloon disaster 'blow' for Egyptian tourism - CNN.com</T1>
<T1.1>The tragic hot air balloon crash in Luxor on Tuesday comes at a time when Egypt's tourism industry has been struggling to prove that the country is still safe to visit in the wake of the 2011 revolution.</T1.1>
<T1.1.3>Nineteen people died when canisters aboard the balloon exploded over Luxor, a popular destination for tourists visiting its ancient temples and tombs.></T1.1.3>
<T1.1.1>International tourism has long been a mainstay of the Egyptian economy, with United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) figures showing it generated $10.1B in 2012.</T1.1.1>
<T1.1.1.1>In terms of the impact on jobs, tourism employs directly nearly 18 million people.</T1.1.1.1>
<T1.1.2>Nadejda Popova, senior travel and tourism analyst at market research company Euromonitor International, acknowledged that the ongoing political unrest -- as well as Europe's economic downturn -- had affected Egyptian tourism.</T1.1.2>
<T1.1.2.1>But she said Egypt remained a key Middle Eastern tourism destination and that there were indications that there had been a slight recovery in 2012.</T1.1.2.1>
<T1.1.2.1.1>In 2012, Russia remained one of the leading countries in terms of arrivals, alongside travelers from the UK, Germany and Italy, but the tourism ministry was trying to lure in more travelers from other markets such as Asia and Latin America, she said.</T1.1.2.1.1>
<T1.1.2.2>Euromonitor's preliminary figures suggested that there had been a 4% rise on 2011 to 9.4 million tourism arrivals -- as well as signs investors had not given up on Egypt's tourism market, she said.</T1.1.2.2>
<T1.1.2.2.1>The UNWTO's 2012 data also pointed to what Carvao described as "a clear recovery in demand", with a 17% increase in tourism arrivals, to 11.2 million.</T1.1.2.2.1>
<T1.1.2.2.2>However, Popova said numbers were still down, with the political transition "heavily impacting" Egyptian tourism.</T1.1.2.2.2>
<T1.1.2.2.3>Popova said she expected numbers to return to their pre-crisis levels by 2017.</T1.1.2.2.3>
<T1.1.2.3>Earlier this month Egypt's tourism minister, Hisham Zazou, told CNN that live webcams were being installed in holiday hotspots to prove that the country's tourism industry was healthy.</T1.1.2.3>
<T1.1.2.3.1>Footage of holidaymakers "basking in the sun" would give Egypt's tourism industry more credibility, he said.</T1.1.2.3.1>
<T1.1.3.1>Officials said those on board included nine tourists from Hong Kong, four from Japan, three from Britain, two from France and one from Hungary. </T1.1.3.1>
<T1.1.3.2>"Even though -- during the entire two years to my knowledge -- not a single tourist has been harmed, it gives the impression of a state unraveling where security cannot be guaranteed," he said.</T1.1.3.2>
<T1.1.3.3>Egypt's temporary ban on balloon flights -- introduced after the crash -- was "an indication the authorities are concerned not only about the safety of the people but also about their image and how people perceive them," she said.</T1.1.3.3>
