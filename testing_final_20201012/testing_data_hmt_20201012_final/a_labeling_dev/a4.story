<T1>Editor's note: Are you worried about North Korea's nuclear tests?</T1> 
<T1.1>North Korea appears to have conducted an underground nuclear bomb test Tuesday, as the U.S. Geological Survey reported a seismic disturbance centered near the site of the secretive regime's two previous nuclear tests.</T1.1>
<T1.1.1>What happens with an underground nuclear test?</T1.1.1>
<T1.1.1.1>Once a nuclear device is exploded, seismographs around the world will detect the movement.</T1.1.1.1>
<T1.1.1.2>The blowout released a radioactive cloud nearly 10,000 feet high."</T1.1.1.2>
<T1.1.1.3>Still, nuclear particles can be accidentally released into the atmosphere.</T1.1.1.3>
<T1.1.1.4>A third nuclear test could enable North Korea the technical data needed to miniaturize a warhead, according to a recent paper in the "Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists."</T1.1.1.4>
<T1.1.1.5>Coming on the heels of December's successful launch of a satellite, the threat of an atomic test has raised concerns.</T1.1.1.5>
<T1.1.2>Satellite photos showed the preparation of a third tunnel in Punggye-ri area, located 232 kilometers northeast of Pyongyang near the Sea of Japan, where the two previous tests were located.</T1.1.2>
<T1.1.2.1>Work appeared to begin in 2009 and now is largely completed.</T1.1.2.1>
<T1.1.2.2>Analysts estimate the new tunnel is one kilometer long and 380 meters deep.</T1.1.2.2>
<T1.1.2.3>Holes are cut 1 to 3 meters wide and up to a kilometer deep.</T1.1.2.3>
<T1.1.2.4>The atomic devices are assembled on site and placed in the hole, usually accompanied by lead-protected diagnostic canister that contains sensors to record the explosion.</T1.1.2.4>
<T1.1.2.5>The tunnel is then filled with layers of pea gravel, sand and other materials to prevent radioactive material from being released into the atmosphere.</T1.1.2.5>
<T1.2.3>During a test, the explosion energy is released in less than a millionth of a second, according to CTBTO.</T1.2.3>
<T1.2.3.1>The temperature will reach about a million degrees within a few microseconds, and shockwaves from the blast, depending on the size, can be detected by seismographs around the planet.</T1.2.3.1>
<T1.3>Is underground testing dangerous?</T1.3>
Of the more than 2,000 nuclear detonations since 1945, 75% of the explosions have been tests conducted underground, largely by the major nuclear powers of the United States, the former Soviet Union (now Russia), Britain, France and China, according to the CTBTO.
<T1.3.1>Underground testing is much safer than above-ground testing.</T1.3.1>
<T1.3.1.1>"With underground testing, you can contain the radiation," said Annika Thunborg, CTBTO spokesperson.</T1.3.1.1>
<T1.3.1.2>There is always a danger of radiation seeping, hence the total test ban treaty, Thunborg said.</T1.3.1.2>
<T1.3.1.2.1>North Korea's first nuclear test in 2006 leaked radiation into the air which was picked up at a CTBTO monitoring station in Yellowknife, Canada -- more than 4,500 miles away.</T1.3.1.2.1>
<T1.3.1.2.2>But if Pyongyang plans to explode an even larger device, risks elevate as well.</T1.3.1.2.2>
<T1.3.2>Unrecognized complex geological conditions apparently led to a blowout during the 1970 underground Baneberry nuclear test at the Nevada Test Site.</T1.3.2>
<T1.3.2.1>The blowout released a radioactive cloud nearly 10,000 feet high.</T1.3.2.1>
<T1.3.2.2>Such a blowout would also release a lot more data on the test to outside observers, but "spewing a radioactive cloud over the skies of Northeast Asia would create an enormous political storm from the nearby countries," Hecker wrote.</T1.3.2.2>
<T1.4>Why is underground testing controversial?</T1.4>
<T1.4.1>The 1996 treaty, which has been signed by 183 nations, aims to ban all nuclear testing on the planet, whether in the atmosphere or underground.</T1.4.1>
<T1.4.1.1>North Korea is the only country to have carried out atomic explosions on the planet since 1998, when Pyongyang conducted underground nuclear tests in 2006 and 2009.</T1.4.1.1>
<T1.4.1.2>Before that, both India and Pakistan conducted underground tests in 1998, according to CTBTO.</T1.4.1.2>
<T1.4.2>Testing in the atmosphere and underwater was banned by the 1963 Partial Test Ban Treaty, after public concerns over radioactive fallout from tests.</T1.4.2>
<T1.4.2.1>The U.S., the Soviet Union and Britain signed the treaty, but nuclear powers France and China did not.</T1.4.2.1>
<T1.4.2.2>France conducted its last above ground nuclear test in 1974; China in 1980.</T1.4.2.2>
<T1.5>How will we know if North Korea carries out an underground test?</T1.5>
<T1.5.1>Once a nuclear device is exploded, seismographs around the world will detect the movement.</T1.5.1>
<T1.5.1.1>Seismic technology is the core function of any monitoring system, and we are running the only international system that is dedicated to ensure that no nuclear explosion will go undetected in compliance with the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty.</T1.5.1.1>
<T1.5.2>The CTBTO operates a global system of more than 300 monitors -- such as seismic, sonar or radiation sensors -- in 85 countries across the world.</T1.5.2>
<T1.5.2.1>Even if no radiation escapes into the atmosphere, underground explosions leak noble gases into the atmosphere which CTBTO sensors can detect, Thunborg said.</T1.5.2.1>
