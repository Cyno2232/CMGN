<T1>(CNN) -- Track and field star Tyson Gay was handed a one-year ban by the U.S. Anti Doping Agency (USADA) Friday and has had to return the silver medal he won at the 2012 London Olympics.</T1>

<T1.1>Gay, a former world 100 and 200m champion, tested positive for a banned anabolic steroid at the U.S. Championships on June 23, 2013 and his suspension takes effect from that date -- making him eligible to compete later this summer.</T1.1>

<T1.2>The standard ban for a doping violation is two years, but Gay has been treated more leniently because he co-operated with USADA, it said.</T1.2>
<T1.2.1>"We appreciate Tyson doing the right thing by immediately withdrawing from competition once he was notified, accepting responsibility for his decisions, and fully and truthfully cooperating with us in our ongoing investigation into the circumstances surrounding his case," USADA chief executive Travis T. Tygart told the organization's official website.</T1.2.1>

<T1.3>The shortened suspension length is subject to appeal by the IAAF and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) but the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said it was satisfied with the punishment meted out to Gay.</T1.3>

<T1.4>He won the triple of 100, 200 and 4x100m relay gold at the 2007 world championships in Osaka.</T1.4>
