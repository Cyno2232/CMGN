<T1>(CNN) -- At the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the passage of the Civil Rights Act, four presidents remembered the battles and honored those who fought to form "a more perfect union" on the path to economic, educational and voting equality.</T1>

<T1.1>The four presidents -- Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama -- led the observances, appropriately, at the Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library in Austin.</T1.1>
<T1.1.1>It was President Johnson who in 1964 secured the passage of the Civil Rights Act, and in 1965, the Voting Rights Act -- the latter eviscerated last year by the Roberts Court.</T1.1.1>

<T1.2>President Obama thanked "the warriors for justice, the elected officials and community leaders who are here today."</T1.2>
<T1.2.1>Those who ended segregation and ushered in the most significant change in America since the Civil War were indeed, "warriors for justice."</T1.2.1>
<T1.2.2>One of the warriors present was Rep. John Lewis who was in his 20s when the battles for Civil Rights were raging across the South, and indeed, all America.</T1.2.2>
<T1.2.2.1>It was men and women warriors like Lewis who first moved Americans, and then moved the federal government, to guarantee the basic human rights they demanded.</T1.2.2.1>
<T1.2.2.2>Introducing the President, Lewis said, "President Barack Obama was born into a dangerous and difficult time in American history, a time when people were arrested and taken to jail just for sitting beside each other on the bus."</T1.2.2.2>
<T1.2.3>President Obama keyed his theme to honor President Johnson.</T1.2.3>
<T1.2.3.1>"Because of the civil rights movement, because of the laws that Lyndon Johnson passed, new doors swung open," he said.</T1.2.3.1>

<T1.3>Earlier in the week, former President Jimmy Carter struck a similar theme: "We still have gross disparity between black and white people on employment (and) the quality of education," said Carter.</T1.3>

<T1.4>Former President Bill Clinton homed in on the erosion of the Voting Rights Act, and partisan divisions.</T1.4>
<T1.4.1>"We all know what this is about: This is a way of restricting the franchise after 50 years of expanding it," Clinton said.</T1.4.1>
<T1.4.2>Obama echoed Clinton, saying, "One concern I have sometimes during these moments (is that) from a distance, sometimes ... they seem easy.</T1.4.2>
<T1.4.2.1>All the pain and difficulty and struggle and doubt -- all that is rubbed away."</T1.4.2.1>

<T1.5>Bush reminded the audience about the importance of education in ensuring equality for all.</T1.5>
<T1.5.1>"It is not a coincidence that many of the defining struggles of the civil rights era -- from Little Rock Central to the University of Mississippi -- took place in educational settings.</T1.5.1>
<T1.5.2>Through civil rights laws, we assure justice in the present.</T1.5.2>
<T1.5.2.1>Through education, we secure justice for the next generation."</T1.5.2.1>

<T1.6>Obama exhorted young people especially not to succumb to despair or cynicism because the struggle seems too hard.</T1.6>
<T1.6.1>"We've got a debt to pay," he said.</T1.6.1>

<T1.7>President Johnson "believed that together we can build an America that is more fair, more equal, and more free than the one we inherited.</T1.7>
