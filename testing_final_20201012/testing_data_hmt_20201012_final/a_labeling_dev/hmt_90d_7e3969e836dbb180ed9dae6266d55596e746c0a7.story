<T1>Guantanamo Bay, Cuba (CNN) -- Silence and the odd outburst from accused 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four others turned an arraignment that could have lasted minutes into a 13-hour court session at Guantanamo Bay on Saturday.</T1>

<T1.1>It was the first appearance in a military courtroom for Mohammed and four others since they were charged last month for their alleged role in the planning and execution of the September 11, 2001, terror attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people.</T1.1>
<T1.1.1>The hearing, which wrapped just before 10:30 p.m., offered a rare glimpse of the five men who have not been seen publicly since 2008 when they were first charged by a military tribunal.</T1.1.1>

<T1.2>Mohammed and the others -- Walid Muhammad Salih, Mubarak bin 'Attash, Ramzi Binalshibh, Ali Abdul Aziz Ali, and Mustafa Ahmed Adam al Hawsawi -- appeared to work together to defy the judge's instruction, refusing to speak or cooperate with courtroom protocol.</T1.2>
<T1.2.1>The silence from the defendants -- some ignored the judge and others appeared to be reading -- slowed the proceedings to a crawl.</T1.2.1>

<T1.3>All five men are charged with terrorism, hijacking aircraft, conspiracy, murder in violation of the law of war, attacking civilians, attacking civilian objects, intentionally causing serious bodily injury and destruction of property in violation of the law of war.</T1.3>
<T1.3.1>If convicted, they face the death penalty.</T1.3.1>

<T1.4>The next hearing is scheduled for June 12.</T1.4>
<T1.4.1>It will likely be at least a year before the case goes to trial, Pohl said.</T1.4.1>

<T1.5>Hours into Saturday's proceeding, one of the defendants broke his silence with an outburst.</T1.5>
<T1.5.1>Binalshibh shouted in heavily accented English: "You may not see us anymore," he said.</T1.5.1>
<T1.5.1.1>"They are going to kill us."</T1.5.1.1>

<T1.6>The military initially charged Mohammed in 2008, but President Barack Obama stopped the case as part of his effort to close the U.S. detention center at Guantanamo Bay, a U.S. naval base in Cuba.</T1.6>
<T1.6.1>Unable to close the center, Obama attempted to move the case to federal court in New York in 2009, only to run into a political firestorm.</T1.6.1>
<T1.6.2>The plan was dropped after complaints about cost and security.</T1.6.2>
