<T1>(CNN)With its snow-capped mountains and picturesque deserted hamlets, the Bleone Valley, where a Germanwings jet crashed Tuesday, is a stunningly beautiful but sparsely populated spot.</T1>

<T1.1>But the remoteness -- which appeals to small numbers of holidaymakers looking to ski in winter or take restorative walks through the green hills in the warmer months -- may make reaching the wreckage of the Germanwings plane difficult.</T1.1>

<T1.2>Gilles Gravier, director of the tourist office in Val d'Allos, told French newspaper Liberation the crash occurred in a particularly steep spot on the Trois Eveches mountain, and may have been witnessed by skiers on the area's slopes.</T1.2>
<T1.2.1>"There is no access by road; emergency crews are coming in by air, using helicopters," he said.</T1.2.1>

<T1.3>Sandrine Boisse, the president of the tourism office at the Pra Loup ski resort, said she heard the plane crash and called the police and the local government office to find out what had happened.</T1.3>
<T1.3.1>"And at first we thought it was an avalanche, but it was strange at this time because it was 11.</T1.3>

<T1.4>French police in the region have pleaded with locals and visitors to stay away from the site, urging them "not to clutter the roads," leaving them clear for emergency vehicles.</T1.4>
