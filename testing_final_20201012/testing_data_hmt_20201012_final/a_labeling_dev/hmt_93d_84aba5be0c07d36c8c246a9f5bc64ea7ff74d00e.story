<T1>(CNN) -- A grandfather who perished in a Christmas day fire at a Connecticut home died from blunt-force head and neck trauma as well as smoke inhalation, while his wife and their three grandchildren died from smoke inhalation, the state medical examiner's office said Wednesday.</T1>

<T1.1>Authorities said on Tuesday that Lomer Johnson fell through roof rafters outside a window.</T1.1>
<T1.1.1>One of the children's bodies was found just inside the window.</T1.1.1>
<T1.1.2>It appeared Johnson was trying to get the child out, but died after climbing through the window, said Stamford, Connecticut, Acting Fire Chief Antonio Conte.</T1.1.2>

<T1.2>Three young sisters -- a 10-year-old and 7-year-old twins -- died in the fire along with the Johnsons.</T1.2>
<T1.2.1>The girls' mother, Madonna Badger, and a friend escaped the blaze.</T1.2.1>

<T1.3>The fire, which broke out about 5 a.m. Sunday morning in the three-story Victorian home, is believed to have been caused by smoldering embers removed from a fireplace about two hours before and taken to an area in the rear of the house, Stamford Chief Fire Marshal Barry Callahan said.</T1.3>

<T1.4>The investigation into the fire continues, officials said.</T1.4>
<T1.4.1>"It's going to take a while," Conte said.</T1.4.1>
