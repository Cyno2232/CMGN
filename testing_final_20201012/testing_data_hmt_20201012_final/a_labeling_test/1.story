<T1>What are people feeling in Afghanistan, and how will this affect the U.S. strategy moving forward?</T1>

<T1.1>(CNN) -- An American soldier went on a house-to-house shooting spree in two villages in the Kandahar region of Afghanistan early Sunday, Afghan officials said, killing 16 people.</T1.1> 

<T1.1.1>NATO's International Security Assistance Force said the soldier acted alone and turned himself in after opening fire on civilians.</T1.1.1>

<T1.2>Q: There were some reports suggesting that perhaps it was several soldiers.</T1.2>

<T1.2.1>The scene is gruesome.</T1.2.1> 
<T1.2.1.1>The scene is gruesome. </T1.2.1.1>
<T1.2.1.2>Since then, the villagers have been accusing the U.S. government of not telling the truth, saying there were more U.S. soldiers on the ground when this happened.</T1.2.1.2>

<T1.3>Q: And are there worries now about reprisals?</T1.3>
<T1.3.1> Yes, the Taliban has already said Monday that there will be reprisals, perhaps violent ones. </T1.3.1>

<T1.3.2>We also know that members of parliament here in Kabul have decided to close down the parliament here in protest of the killings.</T1.3.2>

<T1.3.3>But the anger is growing, and there's a lot of speculation that this really plays right into the hands of the Taliban, who is trying to sort of divide people and trying to say, "look, you can't really trust these coalition forces who claim to be here to help you."</T1.3.3>

<T1.4>Q: And have you heard anything about how this affects the strategy moving forward in Afghanistan?</T1.4>
<T1.4.1>This is certainly going to strain ties again between the Afghan government and the U.S. </T1.4.1>
<T1.4.1.1>President Obama has said he is deeply saddened by what happened and this is a deplorable and regrettable incident.</T1.4.1.1>
<T1.4.1.2>But Afghan President Hamid Karzai has said this is unforgivable and an act of terror, in his words.</T1.4.1.2>
