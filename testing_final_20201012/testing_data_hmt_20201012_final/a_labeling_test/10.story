<T1>(CNN) -- Barcelona may not be the force it once was -- but it still had too much for Manchester City.</T1>

<T1.1>In the end, despite plenty of courage and endeavor, goals from Lionel Messi and Dani Alves decided this tie as Barcelona gained a 2-1 win to progress 4-1 on aggregate.</T1.1>

<T1.1.1>Vincent Kompany had briefly leveled the game with a minute of normal time remaining before Alves struck -- and City finished the game with 10-men after Pablo Zabaleta was sent off.</T1.1.1>

<T1.2>It was City which started the better of the two but the visitor soon began to ride its luck as Barcelona grew frustrated at the decisions of the officials.</T1.2>

<T1.2.1>First, the home side felt it should have been awarded a penalty when Messi went down under the challenge of Joleon Lescott but referee Stephane Lannoy waved away the appeals.</T1.2.1>

<T1.2.2>Unfortunately for Barcelona, the offside flag had been raised, despite Alba clearly being in an onside position.</T1.2.2>

<T1.3>The second half provided more enthralling action with Messi coming within inches of breaking the deadlock after jinking his way into the penalty area before smashing an effort against the post.</T1.3>

<T1.3.1>There was still more drama to come with a little over 12 minutes remaining when Dzeko appeared to be blatantly fouled inside the penalty area by Gerard Pique -- but referee Lannoy disagreed.</T1.3.1>

<T1.3.1.1>But Barcelona refused to be denied and Dan Alves netted a late winner, firing home from Andres Iniesta's pass to secure victory.</T1.3.1.1>
