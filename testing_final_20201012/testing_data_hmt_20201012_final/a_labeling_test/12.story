<T1>(CNN) -- Don't ask music super-producer Benny Blanco to whip up a No. 1 song for an artist because it ain't gonna happen.</T1>
<T1.1>Sure, the man knows how to make hits: His work on Rihanna's "Diamonds" and Ke$ha's "Die Young" landed both at the top of the Billboard charts.</T1.1> 

<T1.1.1>But he's the first to tell you that trying to compose a chart topper is almost always guaranteed to fail."</T1.1.1> 

<T1.1.2>Blanco said in an era where singles rule (seriously, when was the last time you bought an entire album?) the pressure is on labels, artists and producers more than ever to produce a song that will head straight to the top of the charts.</T1.1.2>

<T1.1.2.1>"Everything needs to be a hook," said Blanco, who snagged the Songwriter of the Year Award at the BMI Pop Awards in 2012 along with Ester Dean and Pitbull.</T1.1.2.1>

<T1.1.2.2>"Everything needs to be catchy because a listener is either going to stay with the song or lose interest in the first five seconds. But people also like those songs they can relate to and say, 'Yeah, I went through that.' "</T1.1.2.2>

<T1.1.2.3>Chris Mooney, senior director of artist promotions at TuneCore, said artists looking for a No. 1 song have to prepare their fans for a release by using every social media tool available: YouTube videos, tweets, Facebook postings, etc.</T1.1.2.3>

<T1.2.2.4>But if an artist wants to have a true No. 1 smash across the country, he or she will have to resort to some old-fashioned methods, Mooney said.</T1.2.2.4>

<T1.2.2.5>Stennett said the machine involved in promotion has to remain enthusiastic about the project.</T1.2.2.5>

<T2>The process of putting it all together is as much fun as work, he said.</T2>
