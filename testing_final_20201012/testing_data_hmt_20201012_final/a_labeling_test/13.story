<T1>Jonesboro, Arkansas (CNN) --Three men who served 18 years in prison following their convictions in a 1993 triple-slaying in West Memphis, Arkansas, walked free Friday to cheers from a supportive crowd after entering new pleas in the case.</T1>
<T1.1>Echols and Baldwin entered what is known as an Alford plea on three counts of first degree murder.Misskelley entered similar pleas to one count of first degree murder and two counts of second degree murder.</T1.1>
<T1.1.1>Echols was previously sentenced to death and Misskelley and Baldwin were given life sentences in the May 1993 slayings of second-graders Steven Branch, Christopher Byers and Michael Moore.</T1.1.1>
<T1.1.1.1>The boys' bodies were mutilated and left in a ditch, hogtied with their own shoelaces.</T1.1.1.1> 
<T1.1.1.2>Prosecutors argued that the men who were convicted, teenagers at the time, were driven by satanic ritual and that Echols had been the ringleader.</T1.1.1.2>
<T1.1.2>Critics of the case against the men argued that no direct evidence tied the three to the  murders and that a knife recovered from a lake near the home of one of the men could not have caused the boys' wounds.</T1.1.2> 
<T1.1.2.1>More recent DNA testing also demonstrated no links, according to the men's supporters.</T1.1.2.1>
<T1.2>While prosecuting attorney Scott Ellington said the pleas entered Friday validate the decision of jurors who sent the men to prison, it also spares Arkansas the possibility of a retrial, which would have been difficult to prosecute after so many years, or a potential civil lawsuit by the men.</T1.2> 
<T1.2.1>The trio had been on course to win the right to new trials later this year.</T1.2.1>

<T1.3>The case has drawn national attention, with actor Johnny Depp and singers Eddie Vedder and Natalie Maines trying to rally support for the men's release. </T1.3>
