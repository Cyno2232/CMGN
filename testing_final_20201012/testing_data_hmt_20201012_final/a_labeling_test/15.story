|--1-->[1] 0 (CNN) -- Rep. Nick Lampson, D-Texas, said Tuesday that Federal Emergency Management Agency tried to control the outcome of a scientific study on formaldehyde in trailers used to house victims of Hurricane Katrina.
<T1.1.1>FEMA received that initial report in February 2007.</T1.1.1>
<T1.1.1.1>Formaldehyde is a preservative used in construction materials like plywood.</T1.1.1.1>
<T1.1.1.2>FEMA says about 40,000 families are still living in the travel trailers.</T1.1.1.2>
<T1.1.1.3>Meanwhile, the CDC has been doing a separate study of formaldehyde in the trailers.</T1.1.1.3>
<T1.1.1.4>FEMA says it has offered everyone living in a travel trailer the option of moving to a hotel until alternative housing can be found.</T1.1.1.4>
<T1.1.1.5>The site says the chemical can also be an irritant to the respiratory tract and the eyes.</T1.1.1.5>
<T1.1.2>Well, it's been way past a couple of weeks and now people have been in them a year or 18 months."</T1.1.2>
<T1.2>In addition, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee -- Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, D-Mississippi -- cited medical experts who said prolonged exposure to high levels of formaldehyde can cause ailments ranging from respiratory irritation to cancer.</T1.2>
<T1.2.1>FEMA and the CDC say the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, an arm of the CDC, did an initial assessment for FEMA that wasn't intended to address the long-term effects of extended exposure to formaldehyde.</T1.2.1>
