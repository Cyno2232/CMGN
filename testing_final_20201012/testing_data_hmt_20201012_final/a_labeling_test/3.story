<T1>Russian Parliament backs Crimea vote, brushes off sanctions threat</T1>
<T1.1>Washington (CNN) -- To President Barack Obama and U.S. allies in Europe, Sunday's secession referendum in Crimea is unconstitutional, illegal and a fraud because Russian troops have essentially taken over the southern Ukraine peninsula.</T1.1>
<T1.1.1>Results are expected Monday and U.S. officials have made clear they expect Crimean voters to choose to become part of Russia.</T1.1.1>

<T2>To Russian President Vladimir Putin, it is a chance for Crimean residents to decide if they want to realign their region with Moscow after the political strife in Ukraine that ousted the pro-Russian leader last month.</T2>

<T3>1) What is the Crimean referendum?</T3>
<T3.1>Voters in the autonomous Ukrainian region of about 2 million people will choose between asserting independence from the former Soviet republic or joining neighboring Russia.</T3.1> 
<T3.2>Voters must be older than 18 and bring ID documents to show they are a resident of Crimea in order to cast a ballot.</T3.2> 
<T3.1.3>Results are expected Monday and U.S. officials have made clear they expect Crimean voters to choose to become part of Russia.</T3.1.3>
 
<T4>2) Is it legal?</T4>
<T4.1>In Ukraine, the interim government rejects the referendum as unconstitutional, while many in the pro-Russian Crimea region desire the chance to again align with Moscow. </T4.1>
<T4.2>Russian President Vladimir Putin calls the ousting of Yanukovych an anti-constitutional coup, and he argues the people of Crimea should have the right to decide their future in the same way as other autonomous regions, such as Kosovo's breakaway from Serbia.</T4.2> 
<T4.3>However, Obama and European leaders insist the Crimean referendum would violate the Ukrainian constitution and international law.</T4.3>
 
<T5>3) What would it mean?</T5>
<T5.1>Obama's quick condemnation of a Crimean referendum showed the United States expects the outcome to favor realigning with Russia.</T5.1>
<T5.2>Asked if Crimea and perhaps other parts of eastern and southern Ukraine that favor Russia might end up the same, Power said: "I think it's maybe not helpful to talk about precedents."</T5.2>

<T6>4) Potential fallout?</T6>
<T6.1>For Russia, a major motivation is ensuring control of its Black Sea fleet based in Sevastopol, as well as its economic influence in Ukraine and other former Soviet territories and satellites.</T6.1>
<T6.2>The Crimean referendum would provide an electoral justification for what amounts to a land grab amid Ukraine's political upheaval.</T6.2>
<T6.3>To CNN's Fareed Zakaria, Putin may get his wish with Crimea, but at a cost.</T6.3>
<T6.4>"And, most importantly, the people of Ukraine are now deeply suspicious of Russia. The people in Poland and Hungary and the Czech Republic, or probably in places like Kazakhstan, are all now fearful." </6.4>
