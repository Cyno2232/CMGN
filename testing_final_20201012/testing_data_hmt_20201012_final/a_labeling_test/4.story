<T1>A Minnesota middle school student, with the backing of the American Civil Liberties Union, is suing her school district over a search of her Facebook and e-mail accounts by school employees.</T1>
<T1.1>The 12-year-old sixth grade student, identified in court documents only as R.S., was on two occasions punished for statements she made on her Facebook account, and was also pressured to divulge her password to school officials, the complaint states.</T1.1>
<T1.1.1>The lawsuit claims that her First Amendment rights were violated by employees at Minnewaska Area Middle School, in west-central Minnesota, as well as her Fourth Amendment rights regarding unreasonable search and seizure.</T1.1.1>
<T1.1.1.1>according to the complaint, R.S. felt that one of the school's adult hall monitors was picking on her, so she wrote on her Facebook "wall" that she hated that person because she was mean.</T1.1.1.1> 
<T1.1.1.2>She was in trouble again shortly thereafter for another Facebook post, which asked who turned her in, using an expletive for effect, the lawsuit says. She was given in school suspension and missed a class ski trip.</T1.1.1.2>
<T1.2>The Minnewaska School District denies any wrongdoing.</T1.2>
<T1.2.1>The school district maintains that such searches did not cross any boundaries.</T1.2.1>
