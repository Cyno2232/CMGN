<T1>ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- A Georgia man who spent a year in jail for nonpayment of child support -- despite the fact he has no children -- has been cleared of the debt, his attorney said Tuesday. </T1>
<T1.1>A judge ordered him jailed in June 2008 for failing to support his "son" -- a child who DNA tests proved was not fathered by Hatley.</T1.1>
<T1.1.1>Frank Hatley was ordered to make back payments even after he learned a teenager wasn't his son.</T1.1.1>
<T1.1.1.1>Frank Hatley, 50, spent 13 months in jail for being a deadbeat dad before his release last month.</T1.1.1.1>
<T1.1.1.1.1>But last year he became unable to make the payments and was jailed.</T1.1.1.1.1>
<T1.1.2>A DNA test that year confirmed the child was not fathered by Hatley, court documents said.</T1.1.2>
<T1.1.2.1>The couple never married and never lived together, the documents said.<T1.1.2.1>
<T1.2>The argument for keeping Hatley liable for the back payments, according to the attorney who represented him in 2000, was that he signed a consent agreement with the Office of Child Support Services.</T1.2>
<T1.2.1>The court agreed that Hatley had to comply with the consent agreement for the period he believed the child was his son, said attorney Latesha Bradley.</T1.2.1>
<T1.3>Last week, Cook County Superior Court Judge Dane Perkins signed an order stating, "defendant is no longer responsible for paying any amount of child support." </T1.3> 
<T1.3.1>The order permits the state's Office of Child Support Services to close its file on Hatley.</T1.3.1>
