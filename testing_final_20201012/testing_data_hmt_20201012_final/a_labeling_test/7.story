<T1>New York (CNN) --The British tourist who was struck by a New York City taxi after it jumped a curb had her left leg amputated below the knee, hospital officials said Thursday.</T1>
<T1.1>Sian Green, 23, was at 49th Street and Sixth Avenue -- home to Rockefeller Center and near Radio City Music Hall and Saks Fifth Avenue -- Tuesday morning when she and a bicyclist were both hit by the cab after the driver swerved onto the curb, authorities said.</T1.1>
<T1.2>Given the condition of the lower leg, "replantation was not an option," according to Dr. Spiros G. Frangos of Bellevue Hospital.</T1.2>
<T1.3>As of Thursday, the cab driver did not face criminal charges, police said.</T1.3>
<T1.4>TV's Dr. Mehmet Oz, host of "The Dr. Oz Show," was nearby at the time of the accident and rushed over to assist, according to show rep Tim Sullivan.</T1.4>
<T1.5>"David Justino, a plumber from New York, took action, removing his belt and using it as a tourniquet," Oz said in a Facebook post.<T1.5>
<T1.6>Green's parents released a statement on Thursday, expressing their gratitude to all those that helped during this "difficult time."</T1.6>
