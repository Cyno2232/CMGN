<T1>(CNN) -- Criminal suspects claimed embattled Toronto Mayor Rob Ford tried to buy a damaging video -- months before a tape was publicized showing him smoking crack -- according to court documents released Wednesday.</T1>

<T1.1>Ford wasn't the focus of this investigation, and he has not been charged with a crime.</T1.1>
<T1.1.1>But, after allegedly interacting with several players who were involved in the probe, he ended up getting ensnared in it.</T1.1.1>

<T1.2>According to the documents, police translating a March 27 phone conversation primarily from the Somali language believed that the men were talking about "receiving an offer from Rob Ford in exchange for a video."</T1.2>
<T1.2.1>These conversations don't delve into specifics about what's on the video.</T1.2.1>
<T1.2.2>But earlier this year, allegations surfaced in two media outlets that Ford had been recorded last winter using crack cocaine.</T1.2.2>
<T1.2.3>After that report came out, Ford said he no reason to resign.</T1.2.3>

<T1.3>Yet pressure on him increased earlier this fall when the Canadian city's police chief announced investigators had recovered a video that purportedly showed Ford smoking a crack pipe.</T1.3>
<T1.3.1>He denied being an addict.</T1.3.1>
<T1.3.2>Ford says he didn't lie about crack use</T1.3.2>
<T1.3.3>Even after this admission, Ford refused to resign.</T1.3.3>

<T1.4>"(This other man) says that the Mayor of the City Rob Ford was smoking his rocks today," police said of another phone conversation from shortly before 6 a.m. that April morning.</T1.4>
