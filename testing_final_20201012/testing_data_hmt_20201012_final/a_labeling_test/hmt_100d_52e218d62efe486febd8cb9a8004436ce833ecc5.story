<T1>(CNN) -- A 5-year-old Croatian girl with leukemia will be receiving treatment in America, thanks to her home country's generosity.</T1>

<T1.1>When Nora Situm's mother contacted Croatian media to help raise the $575,000 needed for her daughter's treatment, they made sure that goal was met.</T1.1>

<T1.2>Nora is known in her home country as brave heart, according to Aleksic.</T1.2>

<T1.3>Within weeks of her mother's request, people from all over Croatia donated to Nora's cause, according to Aleksic.</T1.3>

<T1.4>The effort was impressive, given Croatia's feeble economy.</T1.4>

<T1.4.1>Between 2000 and 2007, the country's economy improved slowly, according to the CIA World Factbook.</T1.4.1>

<T1.4.2>But Croatia has yet to recover from an abrupt slowdown in 2008, the CIA said.</T1.4.2>

<T1.5>A flap arose when people heard that an additional $262,000 may be needed for long-term follow-up care for Nora.</T1.5>

<T1.5.1>Fortunately, according to Aleksic, the public and the Croatian government donated money to cover the additional amount, if it proves necessary.</T1.5.1>
