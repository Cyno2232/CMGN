<T1>Geoff Lawton says that permaculture "revs up" systems of soil creation.</T1>

<T1.1>That rich soil lays the groundwork for Lawton's revolutionary method of food production.</T1.1>

<T1.1.1>It's called permaculture.</T1.1.1>

<T1.2>Lawton's friend and mentor, Bill Mollison, developed the process back in the 1970s.</T1.2>

<T1.3>Lawton says it's about rehabilitating areas that have been damaged by pollution or overuse by recycling nutrients and energy back into the soils.</T1.3>

<T1.3.1>Permaculture also takes all the things we need -- our housing, energy sources, food and water supplies -- and tailors them to fit into the natural rhythms of the ecosystem.</T1.3.1>

<T1.3.2>The idea is to work with, not against, nature.</T1.3.2>

<T1.4>Lawton claims this permaculture method can work anywhere in the world, including the desert.</T1.4>

<T1.4.1>On a DVD created by the Permaculture Research Institute of Australia, Lawton shows us what happened when he took this method to places like Morocco and Jordan -- just 80 kilometers from the Dead Sea.</T1.4.1>

<T1.4.2>"People were amazed to see an area that was salty, sandy ground, turn into a lush green forest, that had mushrooms growing from the soil," Lawton said.</T1.4.2>

<T1.5>Interest is also sprouting among young people.</T1.5>

<T1.5.1>Dozens come to Zaytuna Farms every year to learn about the permaculture method.</T1.5.1>

<T1.6>Still, permaculture isn't without its critics.</T1.6>

<T1.6.1>They argue the method is time-consuming in the early stages and that makes the system hard to get off the ground in many places.</T1.6.1>

<T1.6.2>It can be made even more difficult if the people living around the site aren't familiar with the process.</T1.6.2>
