<T1>(CNN) -- Flamboyant carnival musician Michel Martelly edged out former Haitian first lady Mirlande Manigat in a pivotal presidential runoff vote held last month, according to preliminary results released Monday.</T1>

<T1.1>Martelly, 50, took 67.6% of the vote, while Manigat, 70, received 31.5%, according to Pierre Thibault, spokesman for Haiti's Provisional Electoral Council.</T1.1>

<T1.2>After the announcement, streets around the electoral council in Petionville filled with Martelly's spirited supporters, who chanted "Tete Kale," or bald head -- one of Martelly's many nicknames.</T1.2>

<T1.3>Martelly made a name for himself as the singer "Sweet Mickey," who sometimes drank rum straight from a bottle and ripped his clothes off during performances.</T1.3>

<T1.3.1>But he shed his bad-boy image off-stage to take care of his family and educate his children.</T1.3.1>

<T1.4>Martelly said in December that Haiti will go nowhere unless the people have a president they can trust, a president who is honest.</T1.4>

<T1.4.1>I represent the light at the end of the tunnel."</T1.4.1>
