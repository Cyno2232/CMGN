<T1>(CNN) -- For the first time in nearly 600 years, a reigning pope has resigned.</T1>

<T1.1>And in what might also be a landmark event, Twitter was not flooded with jokes or parody accounts when the announcement was made two weeks ago.</T1.1>

<T1.2>Although a parody account, @RetiredPopeXVI, did appear, it only has 577 followers and sent out a paltry five tweets.</T1.2>

<T1.3>That all changed on Thursday when Pope Benedict XVI slipped off his red loafers and officially became pope emeritus.</T1.3>

<T1.4>Curiously, the Vatican also deleted all 39 of his tweets from the official @pontifex Twitter account.</T1.4>
