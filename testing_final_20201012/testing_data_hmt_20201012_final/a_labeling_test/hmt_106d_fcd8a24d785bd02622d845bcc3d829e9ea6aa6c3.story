<T1>(CNN) -- What is President Obama up to?</T1>

<T1.1>After all, this is the same president who ran for re-election packaged as a kinder and gentler alternative to cold-hearted Republicans who wanted illegal immigrants to "self deport" while, back at the ranch, the Department of Homeland Security was removing illegal immigrants 24/7 at a record pace.</T1.1>

<T1.2>But there are two bright spots in Obama's immigration record.</T1.2>

<T1.2.1>Last summer, the White House announced a policy change that lets undocumented young people avoid deportation by applying for deferred action and two-year work permits.</T1.2.1>

<T1.2.2>And last month, in a much more obscure change, the administration said it would ease requirements to help undocumented immigrants who seek permanent residency and must return to their home countries to do so.</T1.2.2>

<T1.3>Now Obama wants to go further.</T1.3>

<T1.3.1>According to the New York Times, Obama plans to finally make good on a 2008 campaign promise and push Congress in the next few months to move quickly on comprehensive immigration reform.</T1.3.1>

<T1.3.2>His plan, which he is expected to unveil in the State of the Union address on February 12, includes a path to citizenship for most of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States.</T1.3.2>

<T1.4>This time, the major sticking point is likely to be citizenship.</T1.4>

<T1.4.1>Democrats, including Obama, have said they won't budge on their demand that undocumented immigrants get not just legal status, but also a pathway to citizenship.</T1.4.1>

<T1.5>The GOP brand is so toxic with Latino immigrants right now that we could be talking about millions of new Democratic voters, which is precisely why the GOP won't go along with immigration reform if a direct path to citizenship is in the mix.</T1.5>

<T1.5.1>As for whether it should be, I don't think so.</T1.5.1>

<T1.5.2>Here are three reasons why not:</T1.5.2>

<T1.5.2.1>-- Illegal immigrants don't care about citizenship nearly as much as politicians do.</T1.5.2.1>

<T1.5.2.2>-- As long as Republicans are dead-set against citizenship, we'll never get a deal on immigration reform because -- unlike the health care debate -- this issue doesn't unite Democrats.</T1.5.2.2>

<T1.5.2.3>-- U.S. citizenship is something special, and it has great value.</T1.5.2.3>

<T1.6>But, when that happens, the people who lose are the very ones who many people say they want to help -- those 11 million undocumented immigrants who live in the United States and contribute to our economy.</T1.6>

<T1.6.1>They deserve a pathway to legal status, and a final resolution to a debate that really isn't as difficult as some make it.</T1.6.1>
