<T1>(CNN) -- On my first visit to Italy, at the age of 18, I fell in love with the country and its amazing history almost at first sight, as I and my friends sailed across the lagoon on the ferry to Venice.</T1>

<T1.1>This was my first glimpse of the split personality of a country that is expressed nearly 40 years later in the title of my 2012 book, "Good Italy, Bad Italy," and is the theme of the new film I have just narrated for the Italian director Annalisa Piras, "Girlfriend in a Coma".</T1.1>
<T1.1.1>Yet what I didn't realize then, as a (fairly) innocent teenager, was quite how significant Italy's history is for the whole of the West.</T1.1.1>

<T1.2>In medieval times La Serenissima, as Venice is known, became the richest and most powerful city-state in the Mediterranean.</T1.2>
<T1.2.1>It was run by a quasi-democratic "grand council", made up of the merchants who were making the city rich, an elite that was open to newcomers if they had new ideas and new energies.</T1.2.1>
<T1.2.2>But in the 14th century the elite decided to close its doors to newcomers, allowing in only those related by family to the old guard, and nationalizing trading rights.</T1.2.2>
<T1.2.2.1>The decline of Venice began with that decision.</T1.2.2.1>

<T1.3>During the 1950s and 1960s, the country was Europe's own "emerging economy" of the period, enjoying the third fastest average annual GDP growth rate in the world during those decades, beaten only by Japan and South Korea.</T1.3>
<T1.3.1>It was helped by the global move towards freer trade and by the early European Union, but also by its own then very dynamic society and economy.</T1.3.1>
<T1.3.2>New, entrepreneurial companies were formed, new ideas blossomed; Italy became a pioneering center for design, for cinema, and for fashion, and the migration of millions of workers from the poor south to the industrializing north provided the factories with labor at a competitive price.</T1.3.2>

<T1.4>But then old demons came back to haunt Italy.</T1.4>
<T1.4.1>Public pensions became the main form of unemployment insurance, as unwanted workers were permitted to retire early and draw pensions.</T1.4.1>
<T1.4.1.1>But public debt became the main albatross around Italy's neck as governments ran budget deficits that in 1975-95 averaged (yes, averaged) almost 10% of GDP each and every year.</T1.4.1.1>
<T1.4.1.2>The result: a pioneering crisis of sovereign debt and a foretaste of the crises now roiling the eurozone, as Italy's debt load reached 120% of GDP in the early 1990s and sent the country into near bankruptcy.</T1.4.1.2>
<T1.4.2>That financial crisis, in the course of which the Italian lira was ejected from Europe's pre-euro exchange-rate system (along with Britain's pound sterling) coincided with a huge political crisis, as corruption investigations brought crashing down the parties that had dominated Italian politics for the past 40 years.</T1.4.2>
<T1.4.2.1>The crisis brought talk of a new start, a "second republic" (to succeed the first, formed with the postwar constitution in 1945-48) and even a renaissance.</T1.4.2.1>
<T1.4.2.2>In the interim, governments led by so-called technocrats (a professor, a governor of the Bank of Italy, an ex-diplomat) were brought in to make reforms and give the country a much needed "reset" before normal politics would be resumed.</T1.4.2.2>
<T1.4.2.2.1>It didn't happen.</T1.4.2.2.1>

<T1.5.1>Hence, 20 years later, Italy finds itself in yet another crisis, one that looks eerily similar.</T1.5.1>
<T1.5.1.1>Prime Minister Monti succeeded in stabilizing the public finances, but at the cost of a deeper recession than in all other eurozone economies except Greece and Spain.</T1.5.1.1>
<T1.5.1.2>Beyond that, however, no major reforms have been implemented -- so the justice system remains painfully slow, the labor laws still discourage hiring while leaving millions of young people on poorly paid temporary contracts, competition remains overly restricted, too many markets are over-regulated, meritocracy remains stunted, corruption remains rife, and the huge cost of politics and political privileges has been left unchanged.</T1.5.1.2>

<T1.5.2>Resistance from entrenched interest groups has been strong.</T1.5.2>

<T1.5.3>The big question, however, is why Italians have allowed this to happen.</T1.5.3>
<T1.5.3.1>The answer in our film, "Girlfriend in a Coma", is taken from Italy's, and arguably Europe's, greatest ever poet: Dante Alighieri.</T1.5.3.1>

<T1.5>In his "Divine Comedy" of the 14th century, the sin he condemned most vigorously was "ignavia," by which he meant sloth -- the failure to take responsibility, the failure to show moral courage and to change things.</T1.5>
<T1.5.3.2>That is the coma that filmmaker Annalisa Piras and I diagnose as the Italian condition: economic stagnation, yes, but also a failure of consciousness and responsibility, which is in effect a moral failure.</T1.5.3.2>

<T1.6.1>Umberto Eco, the philosopher and novelist, adds a further explanation in the film.</T1.6.1>
<T1.6>Italians, he says, "do not have a sense of the state."</T1.6>
<T1.6.2>They had and respected a very powerful state in Roman times but that collapsed.</T1.6.2>
<T1.6.3>To make sure they do so, Italians will need to shed their ignavia and to become more active and demanding -- not in their sectional or local interests, but in the national interest.</T1.6.3>
