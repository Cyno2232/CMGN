<T1>Lakeside, California (CNN) -- A handwritten note, handcuff box, camping equipment and a DNA swab kit were among the items found by San Diego deputies in the burned home and garage of James DiMaggio.</T1>

<T1.1>DiMaggio was shot and killed by FBI agents in Idaho after allegedly kidnapping Hannah Anderson,16, this month.</T1.1>

<T1.2>Other items found on the nine-page list of things seized from the home and the adjacent garage include incendiary devices, a gas can, rolls of duct tape, used condoms, ammunition, an arson wire and letters from Hannah.</T1.2>

<T1.2.1>Contents of the letters and the handwritten note were not revealed in the affidavit.</T1.2.1>

<T1.3>The list also contained seemingly benign items such as balloons, a fly swatter and a Popsicle box.</T1.3>

<T1.4>Hannah went missing after cheerleading practice in San Diego County on August 3.</T1.4>

<T1.4.1>The next day, the bodies of her mother, Christina Anderson, 42, and brother, Ethan, 8, were found at the DiMaggio property.</T1.4.1>

<T1.5>The ordeal ended August 10 after authorities spotted DiMaggio and his teenage captive's campsite near Morehead Lake.</T1.5>

<T1.5.1>Eventually, they got close enough, and an FBI tactical agent fatally shot DiMaggio, before whisking Hannah away.</T1.5.1>

<T1.6>Days after being rescued in the Idaho wilderness Hannah attended a fundraiser on Thursday for her and her family near their Southern California home.</T1.6>

<T1.6.1>"This is a small community that we are a part of, and the community came together putting on this great fundraiser for Hannah and hopefully for her future and healing," Brett Anderson said, before he thanked local residents, family and friends, the media and law enforcement.</T1.6.1>
