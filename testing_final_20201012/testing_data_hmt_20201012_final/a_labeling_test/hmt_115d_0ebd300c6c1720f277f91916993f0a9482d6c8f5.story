<T1>Some three months after pro-Russian rebels declared an independent "Donetsk People's Republic," Ukrainian government forces are encircling the city of Donetsk.</T1>

<T1.1>Photojournalist Jonathan Alpeyrie was in the city in May and returned two weeks ago to find it battle-scarred and slowly draining of life as its people flee.</T1.1>

<T1.1.1>The images he has captured show the anguish of the immediate aftermath of shelling -- the relatives of victims, people left homeless, the dead.</T1.1.1>

<T1.1.2>Others depict those left behind sheltering in Soviet or WWII-era cellars and boarded-up buildings as their homes are engulfed by the conflict.</T1.1.2>

<T1.2>The center of Donetsk, in peacetime much like any other modern city, is less damaged, though suffering from water shortages and largely shut down, he says, abandoned by an estimated half of Donetsk's population of around one million.</T1.2>

<T1.3>The day before Alpeyrie spoke to CNN, the group he was with -- fellow photographers and a local driver/translator -- had almost been killed in the town of Marynivka.</T1.3>

<T1.4>Many of those still facing the dangers of Donetsk have sent their children away, Alpeyrie says.</T1.4>
