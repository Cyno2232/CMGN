<T1>But Bashar al-Assad, the president of embattled Syria, is a survivor.</T1>

<T1.1>He's remained ensconced in power despite an 11-month popular uprising, a bloody government crackdown against civilians, and world outrage at the tales and videos filtering out of Syria.</T1.1>

<T1.2>Observers say he's been able to stay in power with a combination of regime ruthlessness, diplomatic subterfuge, and internal sectarian dynamics.</T1.2>

<T1.3>Rafif Jouejati, spokeswoman for the Local Coordination Committees, the Syrian opposition group, said that when al-Assad came to power in 2000, he inherited a Soviet-style intelligence network erected by his father, Hafez Assad, who ruled from the early 1970s till his death in 2000.</T1.3>
<T1.3.1>That spider web of agencies has served to control popular discontent, she said.</T1.3.1>
<T1.3.1.1>"He has a network within a network within a network of intelligence services."</T1.3.1.1>
<T1.3.1.2>Al-Assad has continued what she calls "the family tradition."</T1.3.1.2>
<T1.3.1.3>The repression has generated the widespread fear "embedded in day-to-day life" among the populace.</T1.3.1.3>
<T1.3.2>"In Syria, there are dozens of Mukhabarat-types of agencies that spy on one another," she said, using an Arabic term for intelligence agencies.</T1.3.2>
<T1.3.3>Jouejati said Hafez Assad has able to strike a deal with business elites 30 years ago during popular tumult then.</T1.3.3>
<T1.3.3.1>"That's been an important factor" and "up until recently" Bashar al-Assad has had the support of the business community.</T1.3.3.1>
<T1.3.4>"They are raising the level the violence," she said.</T1.3.4>
<T1.3.4.1>She said al-Assad staked out his position "at a time when the world is sort of getting smaller and everybody is more aware of human rights and individual rights and governments are pushing people for more transparency."</T1.3.4.1>
<T1.3.4.2>He missed a "tremendous opportunity" to work for that kind of change in his own country, she said.</T1.3.4.2>

<T1.4>Andrew Tabler, a Syria expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said he thinks al-Assad has been more brutal than Mubarak and Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic.</T1.4>
<T1.4.1>"He's been willing to use live fire extensively," he said.<T1.4.1>
<T1.4.1.1>"He's just ruthless."</T1.4.1.1>
<T1.4.2>And in a reference to world and regional powers, Tabler said "very simply we have not been ruthless with him."</T1.4.2>
<T1.4.3>But Tabler said al-Assad has done "a very good job of confusing diplomats."</T1.4.3>

<T1.5>Salman Shaikh, director of the Brookings Doha Center, said al-Assad has been able to maintain some popular support with his rhetoric and has not been shy about using force over the years, even against people who were encouraged to open up and air their thoughts.</T1.5>
<T1.5.1>"He's convinced everyone he's been a reformer," he said.</T1.5.1>
<T1.5.2>He is widely unpopular now in the Arab world, but many in the region have liked his stance against Israel.</T1.5.2>
<T1.5.3>Al-Assad has modernized the government apparatus -- the omnipresent Baathist rule and its "deep state."</T1.5.3>
<T1.5.3.1>He and the regime have had a "certain strength" from different sectors of society, such as the business community.</T1.5.3.1>
<T1.5.3.2>There are Sunnis who support his regime and al-Assad's wife, Asma, comes from a Sunni background.</T1.5.3.2>

<T1.6>Aram Nerguizian, visiting fellow, Burke chair in strategy, at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said al-Assad's support is dwindling, but he's been able to buy time for a number of reasons.</T1.6>
<T1.6.1>"Assad has and still continues to benefit from the fact that a mainly rural uprising has to make its way into the urban strongholds of the regime.</T1.6.1>
<T1.6.1.1>The uprising has had a hard time taking root in major city centers that fear a deeper destabilization of an already weakened Syrian economy," Nerguizian said.</T1.6.1.1>
<T1.6.1.2>In addition, al-Assad's supporters are fearful of recrimination in a post-Assad era, and that gives them pause about backing the opposition, which appears to some as splintered and disorganized.</T1.6.1.2>
<T1.6.2>"The local opposition forces remain deeply divided and have yet to show true unity of purpose, command and control, and a socio-economic platform that the average Syrian can look to as a viable and stable alternative to the ruling Assad regime.</T1.6.2>
<T1.6.3>Most if not all of these groups are unhappy with how the Assad regime has managed Syria's nearly year-long unrest," he said.</T1.6.3>
<T1.6.3.1>But "these groups prefer that Assad remain in power rather bet on opposition forces that remain largely leaderless, divided and appear to be increasingly radicalized."</T1.6.3.1>
<T1.6.3.2>There is also a fear that change will bring instability.</T1.6.3.2>
