<T1>U.S. officers shot a Canadian man who walked toward a border inspection booth waving what they said looked like a handgun early Sunday.</T1>

<T1.1>U.S. Customs and Border Protection said in a statement that the man stopped his car around 3 a.m. near a booth on the Ambassador Bridge, which goes between Detroit and the Canadian city of Windsor.</T1.1>
<T1.1.1>As he walked toward them with what appeared to be a black handgun, the officers ordered him to drop the weapon, the statement said.</T1.1.1>
<T1.1.2>When he pointed it in their direction, they opened fire.</T1.1.2>

<T1.2.1>Officials at first said the man they shot had been waving a handgun.</T1.2.1>
<T1.2>But investigators later determined that the man was holding a replica of a handgun, U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman Kris Grogan said.</T1.2>

<T1.3.1>Authorities have not released the identity of the man, who they described as a Canadian citizen.</T1.3.1>
<T1.3>He was shot in the arm, treated for his injuries and then taken into custody, Grogan said.</T1.3>

<T1.4>Citing Windsor police, CNN partner CTV said the man has had previous encounters with Canadian law enforcement and confronted police officers minutes before the shooting on the bridge.</T1.4>
<T1.4.1>After receiving a call reporting a man with a gun in the parking lot of a McDonald's near the border around 2:40 a.m., Windsor police officers arrived at the scene and ordered the man to drop his weapon, police said.</T1.4.1>
