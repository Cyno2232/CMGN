<T1>(RollingStone.com) -- During a press conference at the Toronto International Film Festival for his documentary "Reincarnated," Snoop Lion (as hip hop star Snoop Dogg now calls himself, since embracing Rastafari and reggae music) told reporters he fully backs President Barack Obama in his bid for re-election.</T1>

<T1.1>"Bush f****d up for eight years, so, I mean, you gotta at least give [Obama] eight years.</T1.1>
<T1.1.1>He cleaned half the s*** up in four years, realistically.</T1.1.1>
<T1.1.2>It ain't like y'all gave him a clean house.</T1.1.2>
<T1.1.3>Y'all gave him a house where the TV didn't work, the toilet was stuffed up -- everything was wrong with the house," he said, drawing laughs from the roomful of media.</T1.1.3>


<T1.2>"So he had to come in and get your thing together, then he knocked down our most hated, the most wanted, the one who had our terror on orange or red or whatever color it was on -- he went and found him, the one Bush couldn't seem to find, the one who seemed to fly away in the dead of night and all that," he continued, referring to Osama bin Laden.</T1.2>
<T1.2.1>Obama "went and found him and knocked him down, so don't forget about that.</T1.2.1>
<T1.2.2>Now everybody is peaceful and able to move and go and have a good time -- it's because he made that happen.</T1.2.2>
<T1.2.3>So give him [another] four years to get his thing together and finish this deal out.</T1.2.3>
<T1.2.4>With his new clean lyrics and ringing endorsement of Obama .</T1.2.4>
