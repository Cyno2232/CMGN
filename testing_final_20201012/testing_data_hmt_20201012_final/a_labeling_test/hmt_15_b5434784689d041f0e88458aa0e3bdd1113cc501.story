<T1>Quantock, the head of detainee operations in Iraq, is echoing a debate raging in Washington.</T1>

<T1.1>BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- The one-star general almost yells when asked to talk about the infamous Abu Ghraib photos showing U.S. soldiers abusing Iraqi detainees.</T1.1>

<T1.2>He carried on -- growing more and more angry.</T1.2>
<T1.2.1>So the next obvious question was, "It makes you angry?"</T1.2.1>
<T1.2.1.1>"It does make me angry," he said.</T1.2.1.1>
<T1.2.2>"Because I think we lost a lot of American lives because of those photos."</T1.2.2>

<T1.3>And there it is -- the issue of detainee abuse and what the U.S. military struggles with, and has struggled with, since the release of those photos in 2004, some of which showed naked prisoners being humiliated, stacked in piles or subjected to mock torture.</T1.3>

<T1.4>Another round of photos allegedly showing further abuse of prisoners was to be released by the end of this month.</T1.4>
<T1.4.1>But President Obama asked that the photos be held back.</T1.4.1>
<T1.4.2>Obama said he believed the release of the pictures could put American lives in danger.</T1.4.2>

<T1.5>1: on one hand transparency; on the other, the safety of U.S. troops.</T1.5>
<T1.5.1>Walking through Camp Cropper -- one of the last remaining U.S. detention centers in Iraq -- it is clear the damaging photos have forced the United States to become more transparent in its dealings with prisoners.</T1.5.1>
<T1.5.2>Inmates in American detention with arrest warrants against them will be turned over to Iraqi authorities under the terms of the U.S.-Iraqi security agreement.</T1.5.2>

<T1.6>The United States very much wants not only to get out of Iraq, but to get out of the detainee operation business.</T1.6>
<T1.6.1>But it has a legal bar to satisfy.</T1.6.1>
<T1.6.2>For its part, the U.S. military said it is inspecting and monitoring nine of the Iraqi facilities where its detainees will go.</T1.6.2>
<T1.6.2.1>Iraqi government authorities maintain that they are treating all prisoners in accordance with international law.</T1.6.2.1>
<T1.6.2.2>But when the United States pulls its last troops form Iraq, the monitoring is likely to stop.</T1.6.2.2>
