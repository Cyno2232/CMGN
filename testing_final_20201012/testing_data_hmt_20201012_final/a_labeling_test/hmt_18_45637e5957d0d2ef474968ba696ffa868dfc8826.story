<T1>(CNN) -- Russia withheld details from U.S. officials about suspicions of Boston Marathon bombings suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev in 2011, information that could have altered the course authorities followed, a U.S. law enforcement official told CNN.</T1>

<T1.1>While Russia did alert U.S. authorities about Tsarnaev's possible extremism, it kept out some facts, namely text messages referencing his desire to join a militant group, the source said.</T1.1>
<T1.1.1>However, sources told the Wall Street Journal that the United States also likely would have withheld such details for fear of divulging intelligence sources and methods.</T1.1.1>

<T1.2.1>In the texts, Tsarnaev wrote to his mother about his interest in joining the militant movement carrying out attacks against Russia in the Caucasus region, the law enforcement source told CNN.</T1.2.1>
<T1.2>The Russians did not pass these texts on to American officials when they passed the original intelligence about Tsarnaev, the source said.</T1.2>

<T1.3>House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Michigan, told the Wall Street Journal that the withheld information could have changed the way U.S. officials worked.</T1.3>
<T1.3.1>Access to the texts "would have allowed the bureau to open an investigation where you could track (Tsarnaev's) communications," he said.</T1.3.1>
<T1.3.2>The names of both Tsarnaev and his mother were placed in a terror database, however.</T1.3.2>
<T1.3.3>Still, Tsarnaev was allowed to travel the next year to a restive Russian region rife with Islamist terror groups, and he returned to the United States after six mysterious months abroad.</T1.3.3>
