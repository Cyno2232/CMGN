<T1>Osmek and a crew of about 20 helpers use low-tech and high-tech methods to guard against bird strikes.</T1>

<T1.1>Wildlife biologist Steve Osmek checks a radar screen for information on birds close to the Seattle airport.</T1.1>
<T1.1.1>He's the wildlife biologist whose job is to make sure that birds don't get in the way of airplanes arriving and departing Seattle Tacoma International Airport.</T1.1.1>
<T1.1.2>Even though the bird strikes that recently caused US Airways Flight 1549 to lose both engines and land in New York's Hudson River has brought greater urgency to the issue, the danger presented by avian life is nothing new to Sea-Tac.</T1.1.2>
<T1.1.3>The airport has had a wildlife biologist on staff since the 1970s, Osmek says, and annually spends about $250,000 on bird-removal operations.</T1.1.3>

<T1.2>First, they combat the environments that attract birds by planting foliage that prevents them from landing and by covering any nearby bodies of  water with netting.</T1.2>
<T1.2.1>"The main thing is to make sure the birds are not used to coming here to the airport," Osmek says.</T1.2.1>
<T1.2.2>"They don't get used to feeding here, nesting here and in turn coming into closer contact with the aircraft."</T1.2.2>

<T1.3>Osmek uses a laser with a scope on it to shine a green light near birds.</T1.3>
<T1.3.1>The light flashing near the birds mimics a predator stalking them, Osmek says, and usually causes them to take flight.</T1.3.1>

<T1.4>For more persistent opponents, Osmek reaches into the deep arsenal of what he calls his "pyrotechnics."</T1.4>
<T1.4.1>They are explosive shells that he uses to ward off birds -- sometimes large flocks of them -- entering airspace near the airport's three runways.</T1.4.1>
<T1.4.2>Osmek says the pyrotechnics only scare the birds and do not harm them.</T1.4.2>
<T1.4.3>Using the pyrotechnics is also economical.</T1.4.3>
<T1.4.3.1>One shell costs about $10, Osmek says, while a bird strike on a plane can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage or much worse.</T1.4.3.1>

<T1.5>But the airport's most valuable tool, Osmek says, isn't one that scares off birds -- it's one that helps find them.</T1.5>
<T1.5.1>In three separate locations around the airport are avian radar terminals that track the birds within six miles of the airport and up to 3,000 feet.</T1.5.1>
<T1.5.2>Innovations to the radar now help airport staff determine at what altitude the birds are flying.</T1.5.2>
<T1.5.3>After studying the radar long enough, Osmek can tell from flight patterns what kind of bird he is looking at.</T1.5.3>

<T1.6>O'Hare in Chicago, JFK in New York and Dallas Fort-Worth are airports slated to receive similar radar systems this year.</T1.6>
