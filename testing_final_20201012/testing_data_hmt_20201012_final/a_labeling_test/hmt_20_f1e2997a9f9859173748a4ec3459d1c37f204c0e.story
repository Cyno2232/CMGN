<T1>(CNN)  -- A history of childhood abuse and use of a provocative online identity increase the risk that girls will be victimized by someone they meet on the Internet, according to a study appearing in the June issue of Pediatrics.</T1>

<T1.1>A study in Pediatrics sought to identify which risk factors are linked to Internet-initiated victimization of girls.</T1.1>

<T1.2>While highlighting the dangers that exist for adolescent girls, the study's authors also offer a word to parents: You can lessen the risks to your children by monitoring their Internet use.</T1.2>
<T1.2.1>The authors sought to identify risk factors connected to increased rates of Internet-initiated victimization of girls.</T1.2.1>
<T1.2.2>They also wanted to find out whether abuse victims showed increased vulnerability to online victimization.</T1.2.2>

<T1.3.1>They found that girls are more likely to experience online sexual advances or have offline encounters if they have previously been abused or have a provocative avatar, which is a digital image meant to represent the user online.</T1.3.1>
<T1.3>Those two factors pose a greater risk to adolescents than perhaps more traditionally considered risks, such as Internet naivete and sexual innocence, the study says.</T1.3>
<T1.3.2>The authors say many Internet-initiated sex crimes originate on social networking sites, which require users to create online identities.</T1.3.2>
<T1.3.2.1>Some sites, such as Second Life, require users to create a character to represent them in the virtual world.</T1.3.2.1>
<T1.3.2.2>Other sites, such as MySpace and Facebook, allow self-descriptions and photographs.</T1.3.2.2>


<T1.4.1>But even there, users can choose what to post, and those identities can shape behavior and interaction online, the study says.</T1.4.1>
<T1.4>"The extent to which provocative self-presentations ... translate into increased online advances or offline encounters is unknown, but it is plausible that these types of presentations constitute an initial invitation for exploitation and a familiar avenue by which sexual advances are initiated," the study says.</T1.4>
<T1.4.2>"Self-presentations can change the way Internet users interact in a manner that increases the risk for online sexual advances," they say.</T1.4.2>
<T1.4.3>The study looked at 104 abused and 69 non-abused girls ages 14 to 17.</T1.4.3>
<T1.4.3.1>Abused adolescents -- who had suffered neglect, physical abuse or sexual abuse -- were recruited from child protective agencies, the authors said.</T1.4.3.1>
<T1.4.3.2>The authors say 40 percent of the girls reported experiencing sexual advances online, and 26 percent reported meeting someone offline after getting to know the person on the Internet.</T1.4.3.2>
<T1.4.3.2.1>Abused girls were much more likely to have experienced both, the authors found.</T1.4.3.2.1>
<T1.4.4>"Results indicated that abuse status was significantly related to online sexual advances, which were, in turn, related to offline, in-person encounters," the study says.</T1.4.4>
<T1.4.4.1>The authors say there was no direct link between abuse and offline encounters, but that a history of abuse puts girls at greater risk.</T1.4.4.1>
<T1.4.5>Looking at the girls' avatar choices, the authors found that girls who present themselves provocatively in body and clothing choices are more likely to have had online sexual advances.</T1.4.5>
<T1.4.5.1>That risk is tied not just to an avatar, but to the overall image a girl projects online, they say.</T1.4.5.1>
<T1.4.5.2>"Those adolescents who may be unaware of how their appearance might be perceived may not, from a developmental perspective, possess the social sophistication necessary to field and ward off sexual advances in ways that protect them from sexually explicit suggestions," the study says.</T1.4.5.2>
<T1.4.6>One significant factor that helped decrease the risk to girls was the presence and influence of caregivers, the authors found.</T1.4.6>
<T1.4.6.1>They urge parents to be aware of how their adolescent girls present themselves on the Internet and be aware that provocative self-presentation might have implications for sexual solicitation.</T1.4.6.1>
