<T1>But Adam Lanza's seemingly innocuous life was thrust into the spotlight when authorities said he perpetrated the second deadliest school shooting in U.S. history.</T1>

<T1.1>By the time he was done, 26 were dead -- 20 of them young students.<T1.1>
<T1.1.1>The bloodshed ended when Lanza's own life did.</T1.1.1>
<T1.1.1.1>He was found dead in a classroom with three firearms: a .223-caliber Bushmaster rifle and two pistols, a Glock and a Sig Sauer.</T1.1.1.1>

<T1.1.2>Before Friday's rampage, authorities said, Lanza killed his mother in their home in Newtown's Sandy Hook community.</T1.1.2>
<T1.2>The mass tragedy left people in the Connecticut town, around the country, around the world asking questions.</T1.2>

<T1.3>He had no known criminal record, a law enforcement official said.</T1.3>

<T1.4.1>One of Lanza's aunts, Marsha, described him as a "quiet, nice kid," but he had issues with learning, she said.</T1.4.1>
<T1.4>But never in trouble with the law, never in trouble with anything."</T1.4>
<T1.4.2>She said Lanza's mother "battled" with the school board and ended up having her son home-schooled.</T1.4.2>
<T1.4.3>"I'm not 100% certain if it was behavior or learning disabilities, but he was a very, very bright boy.</T1.4.3>
<T1.4.3.1>He was smart."</T1.4.3.1>

<T1.5.1>Alex Israel was in the same class at Newtown High School with Lanza, and lived a few houses down from him.</T1.5.1>
<T1.5>"You could definitely tell he was a genius," Israel told CNN, adding she hadn't talked with him since middle school.</T1.5>
<T1.5.2>"He was really quiet, he kept to himself."</T1.5.2>

<T1.6>His former bus driver, Marsha Moskowitz, told CNN affiliate WABC that he was "a nice kid, very polite" like his brother.</T1.6>

<T1.7>A relative told investigators that Lanza had a form of autism, according to a law enforcement official, who spoke under condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the investigation.</T1.7>
<T1.7.1>"Autism is not a mental health disorder - it is a neurodevelopmental disorder.</T1.7.1>

<T1.8>A former classmate told CNN affiliate WCBS that Lanza "was just a kid" -- not a troublemaker, not anti-social, not suggesting in any way that he could erupt like this.</T1.8>
<T1.8.1>"I don't know who would do anything like this," the classmate said, before walking away distraught.</T1.8.1>
<T1.8.2>"This is unspeakable."</T1.8.2>
