<T1>LONDON, England (CNN) -- Sportsmen and women being caught taking drugs is not a new phenomenon -- but it's still a shock when the news breaks.</T1>

<T1.1>Romania's Adrian Mutu was sacked by Chelsea and banned from the game for testing positive for cocaine.</T1.1>
<T1.1.1>he history of sport is peppered with drug use, usually of the performance-enhancing kind: athletics has been blighted by it, cycling has lost much of its credibility because of it and baseball has proven to be far from immune.</T1.1.1>
<T1.1.2>But football, the world's most popular game in terms of fan following and participation, does not seem to have had its share of drugs scandals, not least in the world's most high profile division, the English Premier League.</T1.1.2>
<T1.1.2.1>No top-flight player in English football has ever tested positive for using performance-enhancing drugs in a league match.</T1.1.2.1>
<T1.1.2.2>The closest anyone has come is Middlesbrough FC defender Abel Xavier, who was banned from football by UEFA for 18 months in 2005 when he tested positive for the steroid dianabol after a UEFA Cup match.</T1.1.2.2>

<T1.2>The English Football Association (FA) takes its lead on doping from UK Sport, the body which regulates drug testing in the UK based on the code set out by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).</T1.2>
<T1.2.1>UK Sport's Russell Langley does not believe more tests would necessarily return more positive results.</T1.2.1>
<T1.2.2>"Testing at no notice and out of competition is where we think we've got the best chance of being able to catch any sportsmen taking drugs," he added.</T1.2.2>
<T1.2.2.1>English footballers can be tested after matches (in competition) and at training sessions (out of competition).</T1.2.2.1>
<T1.2.2.2>It means the chances are small of catching any Premier League star who may be using drugs.</T1.2.2.2>

<T1.3>Down the years, Italy's Serie A has seen the most cases of players getting caught with either performance-enhancing or recreational drugs in their system.</T1.3>
<T1.3.1>One reason for this is the Italian authorities' no-nonsense stance: two players from each squad are drawn at random to be tested after every match.</T1.3.1>
<T1.3.1.1>And it has worked.</T1.3.1.1>
<T1.3.2>Household names such as Jaap Stam, Edgar Davids, Pep Guardiola, Fernando Couto, Francesco Flachi, Mohamed Kallon and Diego Maradona have all been caught in the last two decades.</T1.3.2>
<T1.3.3>But on the issue of combating social drugs -- something not demanded by WADA's code -- Langley believes the FA's stance is to be applauded.</T1.3.3>

<T1.4.1>"This carries a different set of sanctions which are controlled by the FA and the aim of that program is about rehabilitation rather than punishment."</T1.4.1>
<T1.4>The FA's guidelines state that for a first offence a minimum suspension of three months up to a maximum of two years will apply, but a lack of consistency has always dogged punishments for drug offences.</T1.4>
<T1.4.2>The FA is far from blind to the issue of drugs in English football and since the Ferdinand incident their policies and punishments have been tightened.</T1.4.2>
<T1.4.2.1>But as long as a player's chances of getting caught remain comparatively small, drugs in football appears to be an issue the FA is keeping a lid on rather than eradicating.</T1.4.2.1>
