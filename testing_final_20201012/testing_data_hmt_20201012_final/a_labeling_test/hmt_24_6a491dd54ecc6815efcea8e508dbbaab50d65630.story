<T1>California: Leader in forced sterilizations</T1>

<T1.1>Follett was one of 20,000 Californians forcibly sterilized by the state from 1909 to 1963.</T1.1>

<T1.2>The goal was to rid society of people thought to be undesirable: people labeled "feeble-minded" or "defectives."</T1.2>
<T1.2.1>"It's one of the most horrific and shameful chapters in California's history," said Los Angeles civil rights attorney Areva Martin.</T1.2.1>
<T1.2.2>Thirty-two states had eugenics programs, but California was in a league of its own.</T1.2.2>

<T1.3>In the mid-20th century, the country's intellectual elite such as doctors, geneticists and Supreme Court justices supported forced sterilizations.</T1.3>
<T1.3.1>In California, the eugenics movement was led by figures such as William Starr Jordan, president of Stanford University, and Harry Chandler, publisher of the Los Angeles Times.</T1.3.1>
<T1.3.2>In other states, the sterilization program would stop and start due to legal challenges, but California's ran strong for more than half a century, Cogdell said.</T1.3.2>
<T1.3.3>California's movement was so effective that in the 1930s, members of the Nazi party asked California eugenicists for advice on how to run their own sterilization program.</T1.3.3>

<T1.4.1>Gray Davis apologized for the forced sterilizations, but Follett wants compensation for not be able to have children of his own.</T1.4.1>
<T1.4>"What really ticks me off is, it kills my last name," Follett said.</T1.4>
<T1.4.2>Over the past few years, a friend of Follett's has tried to help him seek justice.</T1.4.2>

<T1.5.1>The governor's office referred CNN to the state Department of Developmental Services, which sent a two-sentence statement: "The State of California deeply regrets the harm caused to victims of involuntary sterilization that occurred through the first half of the 1900s.</T1.5.1>
<T1.5.1.1>This was a sad and painful period in California's history, one that should never be repeated."</T1.5.1.1>
<T1.5.2>When CNN asked Brown for his stance on reparations for sterilization victims, press secretary Gil Duran sent an e-mail referring to the statement.</T1.5.2>
<T1.5.2.1>"There's nothing more to add," he wrote.</T1.5.2.1>
<T1.5.3>CNN also sent e-mails and made phone calls to the office of John Perez, speaker of the California Assembly.</T1.5.3>
<T1.5.3.1>When no response was received, CNN visited his office in Sacramento.</T1.5.3.1>
<T1.5>California's response to victims stands in stark contrast to North Carolina's.</T1.5>
<T1.5.4>North Carolina task force recommends $50,000 for sterilization victims</T1.5.4>
<T1.5.4.1>Bev Perdue has sought out victims and held hearings where she apologized personally and heard their stories.</T1.5.4.1>
<T1.5.4.2>She also set up a task force to help the victims and recommended that each receive $50,000 in reparations.</T1.5.4.2>

<T1.6>Californians, he added, need to face their history and at least hold hearings and invite victims to tell their stories.</T1.6>
<T1.6.1>"California has not done right by these victims," Torres said.</T1.6.1>
<T1.6.2>"But I think California and Californians need to be aware of their history."</T1.6.2>
