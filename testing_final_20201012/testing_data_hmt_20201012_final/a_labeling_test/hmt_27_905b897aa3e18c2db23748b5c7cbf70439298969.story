<T1>Washington (CNN) -- House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa demanded Wednesday that the Federal Election Commission turn over records of more than five years of communications with the Internal Revenue Service -- a move that significantly expands the California Republican's ongoing probe of alleged federal targeting of conservative groups.</T1>

<T1.1>In a letter to FEC Chairman Ellen Weintraub -- a Democrat -- Issa cited CNN reporting on Monday that raises "the prospect of inappropriate coordination between the IRS and the FEC about tax-exempt entities."</T1.1>
<T1.1.1>Among other things, Issa asked for records of all communications between the IRS and the FEC dating back to the start of 2008.</T1.1.1>
<T1.1.2>He also requested records of any FEC discussions relating to tax-exempt applications or organizations since 2008.</T1.1.2>

<T1.2>FEC vice-chair says email raises questions of improper contact with IRS</T1.2>
<T1.2.1>Iss'a letter came after Don McGahn, the vice chairman of the FEC and a Republican, told CNN that he saw an e-mail from an FEC investigator to Lois Lerner, the former head of the IRS division responsible for reviewing applications from various groups for tax-exempt status.</T1.2.1>

<T1.3>IRS, Issa escalate fight over investigation</T1.3>
<T1.3.1>While the prospect of potential FEC involvement with the IRS raises the prospect of a broader federal targeting effort, Democrats continue to insist there is no conspiracy, and stress that the publicly released contact between the two agencies was nothing more than requests for information already in the public domain.</T1.3.1>
<T1.3.2>McGahn told CNN, however, that additional e-mails he has seen do not clearly state whether the FEC was only seeking public data.</T1.3.2>
<T1.3.2.1>Requesting private data would likely violate federal law.</T1.3.2.1>

<T1.4>Issa wants the FEC to turn over the records no later than August 21.</T1.4>
