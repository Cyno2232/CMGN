<T1>I wasn't afraid to die.</T1>

<T1.1>(CNN) -- For 16 glorious years, I taught 11th-graders at a magnet high school in Miami.</T1.1>

<T1.2>For me, teaching wasn't about making a living.</T1.2>
<T1.2.1>It was my life.</T1.2.1>
<T1.2.1.1>Nothing made me happier or more content than standing in front of a classroom and sharing the works of writers such as Shakespeare, Chaucer, Jack Kerouac, Tupac Shakur and Gwendolyn Brooks and watching my students "catch" my passion for language and literature.</T1.2.1.1>
<T1.2.1.2>I loved watching these 15- and 16-year-olds grapple with their first major life decisions -- future careers, relationships, where to live, which colleges to attend, what to study-- at the same moment they're learning to drive and getting their first jobs and experimenting with identity and independence.</T1.2.1.2>
<T1.2.1.3>There wasn't a day when I didn't feel privileged to be part of their metamorphoses and grateful for the chance to affect their lives.</T1.2.1.3>

<T1.3>My classroom was my sanctuary, so on the day before Thanksgiving in 2006 when I was diagnosed with an incurable form of brain cancer at 34 and told I had less than a year to live, I did what I always did.</T1.3>
<T1.3.1>I needed my students to know that I trusted them enough to share life's most sacrosanct passage.</T1.3.1>
<T1.3.2>They, in turn, helped me to live in the moment and spend whatever time I had left living well.</T1.3.2>
<T1.3.3>For six years, the only time I wasn't in class was when I was undergoing brain surgery.</T1.3.3>
<T1.3.3.1>I never avoided the topic of my cancer, glioblastoma multiforme, with my students, but it was not something I dwelled on, nor did they.</T1.3.3.1>
<T1.3.3.2>During that time, I even won "Teacher of the Year" for my region.</T1.3.3.2>
<T1.3.3.3>I was grateful for every breath and felt as if I could live that way forever.</T1.3.3.3>
<T1.3.3.4>Then, two summers ago, the tumor in my head decided to act up.</T1.3.3.4>
<T1.3.3.5>The cancer had finally succeeded in taking me out of the classroom, but I wasn't ready to let it take me out of the game.</T1.3.3.5>

<T1.4>I was afraid of living without a purpose.</T1.4>
<T1.4.1>To paraphrase Nietzsche, a person who has a why to live can always find a how.</T1.4.1>
<T1.4.2>My "why" had always been my students.</T1.4.2>
<T1.4.3>I just needed to find a new "how."</T1.4.3>

<T1.5>I said I wanted to spend whatever time I had left visiting with former students.</T1.5>
<T1.5.1>My purpose was to have a chance to see firsthand how my kids were faring and to witness how, if at all, I had helped shape their young lives.</T1.5.1>
<T1.5.2>It was an opportunity that few people ever get, but many, and particularly teachers, would covet.</T1.5.2>
<T1.5.3>Over the next three months, I traveled more than 8,000 miles from Miami to New York, to America's heartland and San Francisco's Golden Gate, visiting hundreds of my former students along the way.</T1.5.3>
<T1.5.4>What I learned from my travels was that my students had grown up to be kind and caring people.</T1.5.4>
<T1.5.4.1>People who picked me up when I fell over curbs, read to me from books I could no longer see, and cut my food when I could not grasp a knife.</T1.5.4.1>
<T1.5.4.2>They shared with me their deepest secrets, introduced me to their families and friends, sang to me my favorite songs and recited my favorite poetry.</T1.5.4.2>
<T1.5.5>They taught me that what matters is not so much about what we learn in class, but what we feel in our hearts.</T1.5.5>

<T1.6.1>My limbs are withering and my memory is fading.</T1.6.1>
<T1.6.2>Yet as my world dims from the tumor growing in my head, I see ever more clearly the gifts the promise of an early death has brought.</T1.6.2>
<T1.6>And from the lessons I learned on the road, I, to borrow from the great Lou Gehrig, will die feeling like the luckiest man on Earth.</T1.6>
