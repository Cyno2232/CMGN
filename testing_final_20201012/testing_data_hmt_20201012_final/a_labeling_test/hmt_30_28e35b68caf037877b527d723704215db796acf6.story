<T1>(CNN) -- The only thing Venus Williams treasures more than winning is a decent nap.</T1>

<T1.1>Just before a match, when other top tennis players might be psyching themselves up for a three-set onslaught, the elder of the Williams sisters can be found somewhere private, snoozing.</T1.1>
<T1.1.1>"I'm always sleepy," she told CNN in an interview for this month's edition of "Revealed."</T1.1.1>
<T1.1.2>"I'm literally taking a nap during the first set and the match before me, so I'm probably the only person that can go to sleep, come out 15 minutes later and start playing."</T1.1.2>

<T1.2>Wary of sending the wrong signals to her rivals, the sixth seed confessed to CNN that she prefers to take her naps in private.</T1.2>
<T1.2.1>"I'm wondering if my competitor is going to see me here, so I try to act like I'm not asleep, but I am asleep, or I try to find a place where I can sleep in and no one will see me," she laughs.</T1.2.1>
<T1.2.2>The lightning-fast speed of Venus' serve is at complete odds with her personality.</T1.2.2>
<T1.2.2.1>She is strong, ambitious and determined, but also surprisingly laid-back for someone whose professional career is about playing harder, longer and faster.</T1.2.2.1>
<T1.2.2.2>"I just always go with the flow," she told CNN.</T1.2.2.2>
<T1.2.2.3>Her younger sister, world number one Serena, sounds almost envious of Venus' ability to keep her emotions in check.</T1.2.2.3>

<T1.3>Venus made fast work of Russian Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, beating the 17-year-old 6-0, 6-1 in less than one hour in the second round of the Barclays Dubai Tennis Championships.</T1.3>
<T1.3.1>Venus told CNN her ambition this year is to topple Serena to become the world number one.</T1.3.1>
<T1.3.2>"I think I am in a great position to do that," she said.</T1.3.2>
