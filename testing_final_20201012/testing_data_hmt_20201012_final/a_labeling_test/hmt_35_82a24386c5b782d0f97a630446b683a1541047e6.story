<T1>ISIS is a cancer that must be stamped out, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry wrote Saturday in an opinion piece for The New York Times.</T1>

<T1.1>Kerry called the Islamist extremist group, known for beheadings, crucifixions and terror campaigns against religious and ethnic minorities, a "unifying threat to a broad array of countries" that needs to be confronted.</T1.1>
<T1.1.1>His article appears in the aftermath of the political uproar that engulfed the White House this week after President Barack Obama said "we don't have a strategy" on ISIS in Syria.</T1.1.1>
<T1.1.2>Obama's no 'strategy yet' comment on ISIS in Syria sparks a political uproar</T1.1.2>

<T1.2>The ISIS threat only grows over time, and Obama must act with more urgency, the senators wrote.</T1.2>
<T1.2.1>"Doing too little to combat ISIS has been a problem.</T1.2.1>
<T1.2.2>Doing less is certainly not the answer now," they wrote.</T1.2.2>

<T1.3.1>U.S. airstrikes against ISIS fighters have slowed their advance, and the Obama administration is weighing whether to expand the assault into Syria.</T1.3.1>
<T1.3.2>But, Kerry said, any decision will require a joint effort with international partners.</T1.3.2>
<T1.3>"With a united response led by the United States and the broadest possible coalition of nations, the cancer of ISIS will not be allowed to spread to other countries," Kerry wrote.</T1.3>

<T1.4>McCain and Graham said the next move must include a squeezing of ISIS financing, and a successful and inclusive Iraqi government that is inclusive of Iraqi Sunnis, rather than pushing them toward terrorist groups.</T1.4>
<T1.4.1>"But ultimately, ISIS is a military force, and it must be confronted militarily," the senators wrote.</T1.4.1>
<T1.4.2>Obama has ordered airstrikes on ISIS in northern Iraq, but "they have been tactical and reactive half-measures," McCain and Graham wrote.</T1.4.2>

<T1.5>The secretary of state's message echoes that of the White House, with both the President and Press Secretary Josh Earnest calling this week for an international coalition to confront the threat.</T1.5>
<T1.5.1>To build that coalition, Kerry, along with  Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, will meet with European allies on the sidelines of the NATO meeting in Wales next week.</T1.5.1>
<T1.5.2>Then, it's off to the Middle East to drum up support from the region.</T1.5.2>
<T1.5.3>"Already our efforts have brought dozens of nations to this cause," Kerry argued in the Times piece.</T1.5.3>
<T1.5.3.1>"Certainly there are different interests at play.</T1.5.3.1>
<T1.5.3.2>But no decent country can support the horrors perpetrated by ISIS, and no civilized country should shirk its responsibility to help stamp out this disease."</T1.5.3.2>
