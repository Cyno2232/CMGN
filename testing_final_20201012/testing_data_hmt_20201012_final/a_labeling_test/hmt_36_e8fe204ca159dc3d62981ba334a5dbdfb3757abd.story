<T1>Abbottabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The United States will be given access to Osama bin Laden's wives and children, Pakistani Interior Minister Rehman Malik told CNN on Tuesday.</T1>

<T1.1>On Monday, a senior Pakistani intelligence source had said the United States could question bin Laden's wives only if their "country of origin has been asked for permission."</T1.1>
<T1.1.1>One of bin Laden's wives is from Yemen.</T1.1.1>
<T1.1.2>A well-placed U.S. official who would not speak on the record said the other two wives are from Saudi Arabia.</T1.1.2>

<T1.2>White House spokesman Jay Carney said the administration is optimistic that U.S.-Pakistani cooperation "will continue with regards to" access to bin Laden's wives "and also to the materials that were collected by the Pakistanis after the U.S. commandos left" the compound where they killed bin Laden.</T1.2>
<T1.2.1>Carney described the U.S.-Pakistani relationship as "important and complicated."</T1.2.1>
<T1.2.2>Malik called the decision "proof" that Pakistan is "very clear that we didn't know" bin Laden was living in a compound in Abbottabad, a Pakistani city with a major military presence, rather than in mountainous areas which Pakistani and U.S. officials often said were believed to be bin Laden's hiding place.</T1.2.2>
<T1.2.3>One U.S. official said "both sides understand the importance of the relationship," but expressed concerns over Pakistan's control over all of its political participants.</T1.2.3>

<T1.3>All three wives and eight of his children were taken into Pakistani custody after the May 2 raid by U.S. commandos that killed bin Laden, the leader of the al Qaeda terrorist movement.</T1.3>
<T1.3.1>The 29-year-old Yemeni wife, Amal Ahmed Abdulfattah, was wounded during the raid.</T1.3.1>
<T1.3.2>The U.S. official identified the other two women as Khairiah Sabar, also known as "Umm Hamza," and Siham Sabar, or "Umm Khalid."</T1.3.2>

<T1.4>Although U.S. officials have warned of possible reprisal attacks by bin Laden supporters, there has been no surge of attacks inside Afghanistan, the commander of NATO forces in eastern Afghanistan said Tuesday.</T1.4>
<T1.4.1>"There has been a lot of talk about revenge, about (insurgents) coming at both the coalition and the Afghan forces here, but we have not seen that here since the first of May," said Regional Command East Commander Maj. Gen. John Campbell.</T1.4.1>
<T1.4.2>U.S. and coalition forces were already on guard against an expected Taliban spring offensive even before bin Laden's death, Campbell added.</T1.4.2>
<T1.4.2.1>Campbell said he hoped that bin Laden's death, and the images of him inside the compound that the United States released, may discourage insurgents.</T1.4.2.1>
