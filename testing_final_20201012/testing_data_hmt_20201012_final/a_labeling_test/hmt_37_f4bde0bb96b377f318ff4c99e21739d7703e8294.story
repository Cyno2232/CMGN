<T1>(CNN) -- The stadium at the heart of the 2012 London Olympics is set to be transformed into a football ground once the Games have finished, after English Premier League side West Ham were named as the preferred future residents of the venue on Friday.</T1>
<T1.1>The decision ends a period of jostling between West Ham and -- Premier League and London rivals -- Tottenham Hotspur, who were also hoping to relocate to the arena after the Olympics.</T1.1>

<T1.2>The British government still have to finalise the confirmation of West Ham as tenants, but it is expected that they will do do in the coming weeks.</T1.2>
<T1.2.1>The soccer club maintained it was their promise, to retain the stadium's running track in line with the policy of 2012 organizers to leave an athletic legacy in the area, that helped clinch the decision.</T1.2.1>
<T1.2.2>The news is a blow for fifth-placed top flight side Tottenham, who had wished to expand beyond their current facilities at White Hart Lane, with the financial help of American entertainment firm AEG.</T1.2.2>
<T1.2.3>Should the move become official, however, it is not the first time a Premier League club will have taken over an athletics stadium.</T1.2.3>
