<T1>(CNN) -- As with many murder-suicides, the gunman in the Newtown, Connecticut, shooting took to his grave the reasons that compelled him to kill more than two dozen people before taking his own life in the second-deadliest school shooting in U.S. history.</T1>

<T1.1>But those who knew the shooter struggled to reconcile the difference between the quiet, withdrawn 20-year-old without a criminal record and the man who wore black fatigues and a military vest and brought death to Sandy Hook Elementary School Friday.</T1.1>

<T1.2>Police say the shooter, Adam Lanza, killed his mother, Nancy, in their home before walking into the school and fatally shooting 26 more people -- 20 of them children no older than 7.</T1.2>

<T1.3>Police have yet to disclose whether they know a motive for the attack, which has left those who knew Lanza trying to discern whether anything in his past could have foreshadowed the present.</T1.3>

<T1.4>"He was a shy kid, quiet," said Alan Diaz who knew Lanza several years ago.</T1.4>
<T1.4.1>"He would sometimes stand in the corner.</T1.4.1>
<T1.4.2>We knew he was socially awkward and we just accepted it.</T1.4.2>
<T1.4.3>But he was never threatening."</T1.4.3>

<T1.5>'Definitely the challenge of the family'</T1.5>
<T1.5.1>Lanza moved to Connecticut from Kingston, New Hampshire, with his parents and older brother Ryan, according to a booklet for Newtown's Bennetts Farm neighborhood.</T1.5.1>
<T1.5.2>He enjoyed soccer, skateboarding and video games, the publication said.</T1.5.2>

<T1.6>He had no known criminal record, a law enforcement official said.</T1.6>

<1.7>A 'genius'</T1.7>
<T1.7.1>Alex Israel was in the same class at Newtown High School with Lanza and lived a few houses down from him.</T1.7.1>
<T1.7.2>"You could definitely tell he was a genius," Israel told CNN, adding she hadn't talked with him since middle school.</T1.7.2>
<T1.7.2.1>"He was really quiet, he kept to himself."</T1.7.2.1>

<T1.8>How do we stop the violence?</T1.8>
<T1.8.1>A relative told investigators that Lanza had a form of autism, according to a law enforcement official, who spoke under condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the investigation.</T1.8.1>
<T1.8.2>But a national autism committee cautioned against speculating about a link between autism and violence.</T1.8.2>

<T1.9>Lanza's father was also at a loss for explanation.</T1.9>
<T1.9.1>He sent his condolences to the families of victims in a statement released Saturday.</T1.9.1>
<T1.9.2>We are in a state of disbelief and trying to find whatever answers we can."</T1.9.2>
