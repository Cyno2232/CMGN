<T1>Washington (CNN) -- The United States and Japan have agreed that about half the U.S. Marines on the Japanese island of Okinawa will soon leave, a transition that could ease a long-simmering resentment of the Americans' presence that has at times boiled over.</T1>

<T1.1>About 9,000 Marines and their family members will leave Okinawa, the U.S.-Japan Security Consultative Committee said Thursday.</T1.1>
<T1.1.1>About 5,000 will go to Guam as part of a much larger U.S. military build up in Asia, a realignment that comes amid China's rapid growth as a major economic and military power.</T1.1.1>
<T1.1.2>The U.S. military presence on Okinawa has caused considerable controversy.</T1.1.2>
<T1.1.2.1>Some have complained about noise from the base, in an urban area.</T1.1.2.1>
<T1.1.2.2>Many others were incensed by the misconduct of U.S. troops stationed there, including the 1995 rape of 12-year-old Japanese girl by three U.S. military personnel.</T1.1.2.2>
<T1.1.3>"Recognizing the strong desires of Okinawa residents, these relocations are to be completed as soon as possible while ensuring operational capability throughout the process," the U.S.-Japan Security Consultative Committee</T1.1.3>

<T1.2>Japan's foreign minister, Koichiro Genba, called the agreement satisfactory.</T1.2>

<T1.3>"It's forward-looking and meaningful, one that can act upon the changing security environment as well as reducing the burden on Okinawa," Genba said Friday morning.</T1.3>
<T1.3.1>Of the Marines being transferred, about 2,700 will be sent to Hawaii and still others will rotate through a base in Darwin, Australia.</T1.3.1>
<T1.3.2>The transfer leaves between 9,000 and 10,000 Marines belonging to the 3rd Marine Expeditionary Force on Okinawa.</T1.3.2>

<T1.4>Okinawa was the site of the last major campaign for U.S. forces in the Pacific during World War II.</T1.4>
<T1.4.1>The Battle of Okinawa lasted from March through June 1945.</T1.4.1>
<T1.4.2>After the United States defeated Japan in World War II, a U.S. occupation force remained in Okinawa and other parts of the country.</T1.4.2>
<T1.4.3>Japan regained control of the islands in 1972.</T1.4.3>

<T1.5.1>More recently, the United States has kept its forces in Okinawa and increased its military footprint across Asia as China rises as a major economic and military power.</T1.5.1>
<T1.5>The friction between locals and military personnel has been exacerbated in recent years by cultural misunderstandings and the isolated criminal acts.</T1.5>

<T1.6>The call for the U.S. military to leave Okinawa escalated after the 1995 rape of the 12-year-old, a crime that outraged the Japanese and led to calls by many that American troops leave.</T1.6>
<T1.6.1>In 1996, spurred in part by Japanese anger on Okinawa, Washington and Tokyo signed an agreement to reduce the amount of land being occupied by U.S. forces.</T1.6.1>

<T1.7>"I think what we've done with the agreement is ... to create the political space for the government of Japan to move this forward on its own timeline," the defense official said.</T1.7>
<T1.7.1>As part of the agreement, the United States will begin returning lands on Okinawa in phases as the Marines depart.</T1.7.1>
<T1.7.2>Part of the $8.6 billion cost to relocate the Marines from Okinawa to Guam will be picked up by Japan, which has agreed to pay $3.1 billion, the Security Committee statement said.</T1.7.2>
