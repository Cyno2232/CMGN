<T1>(CNN) -- Pink Floyd are not who you think they are.</T1>

<T1.1>It wasn't for nothing that the Sex Pistols' John Lydon scrawled "I HATE" on a Pink Floyd T-shirt (though he later admitted he loved the band).</T1.1>
<T1.1.1>But, almost 45 years on, a closer look at the band's catalog reveals as much hardcore pile-driving ("Run Like Hell") and wistful melodies ("Wish You Were Here") as the long-form "Interstellar Overdrive" space rock with which it's frequently classified.</T1.1.1>

<T1.2>Still, drummer Nick Mason says, it's hard to escape the pigeonholing.</T1.2>
<T1.2.1>"I think these labels are generally delivered by people who sometimes haven't listened to the music," he said in a phone interview.</T1.2.1>

<T1.2>The band's entire studio catalog, including the Syd Barrett-led 1967 debut "The Piper at the Gates of Dawn," the Roger Waters-dominated "The Wall" (1979) and the career-concluding "The Division Bell" (1994), has been remastered and is scheduled for release on Tuesday.</T1.2>
<T1.2.1>"The Dark Side of the Moon," the band's 1973 classic, which still holds the record for longest run on the Billboard album charts, will be issued in three versions: a single CD, a two-disc "Experience Edition" that includes a live album, and a six-disc "Immersion Edition" boxed set.</T1.2.1>

<T1.3>Mason talked to CNN about the band's evolution, the pitfalls of playing live and fantasies about being the Monkees.</T1.3>
<T1.3.1>CNN: How often do you go back and listen to the old material?</T1.3.1>
<T1.3.1.1>Mason: The answer is, I would never willingly put on one of our old records at home for entertainment.</T1.3.1.1>
<T1.3.1.2>What you get is not only the music but the memories that come with it of what you were doing, and how it was in the studio, and all the rest of it.</T1.3.1.2>

<T1.3.2>CNN: There's been the label placed on Floyd as "space rock."</T1.3.2>
<T1.3.2.1>How did you guys take that label?</T1.3.2.1>
<T1.3.2.2>Mason: One tends to try and reject any labeling anyway, as a matter of principle.</T1.3.2.2>
<T1.3.2.2.1>And I think the labels tend to reflect whatever you were doing before.</T1.3.2.2.1>
<T1.3.2.2.2>I think these labels are generally delivered by people who sometimes haven't listened to the music -- sometimes by just looking at the photographs.</T1.3.2.2.2>
<T1.3.2.2.3>If the band have got curly hair and flared trousers, then they're prog-rock or space rock, and if they're very, very grubby, with waistcoats and jeans, then they're an R&B band.</T1.3.2.2.3>

<T1.3.3>CNN: Let's talk about "Dark Side."</T1.3.3>
<T1.3.3.1>Were you aware that you were creating something different?</T1.3.3.1>
<T1.3.3.2>Mason: I don't think so.</T1.3.3.2>
<T1.3.3.2.1>My opinion was that we knew we'd done the best thing so far.</T1.3.3.2.1>
<T1.3.3.2.2>But as I've told people, even if you think you've done the world's greatest record, that does not guarantee that the public will feel the same way.</T1.3.3.2.2>

<T1.3.4>CNN: After that, you guys did play a lot of stadiums.</T1.3.4>
<T1.3.4.1>That led to a lot of discord.</T1.3.4.1>
<T1.3.4.1.1>Was there a time when you thought, I wish I could go back to the clubs?</T1.3.4.1.1>
<T1.3.4.2>Mason: No.</T1.3.4.2>
<T1.3.4.2.1>I don't think there was a wish to go back.</T1.3.4.2.1>
<T1.3.4.2.2>But I think stadiums make quite a lot of bands feel a little uneasy.</T1.3.4.2.2>
<T1.3.4.2.3>I think arenas are fine -- I think arenas are really suited for rock concerts.</T1.3.4.2.3>

<T1.3.5>CNN: How did the band change for you over the years as leadership went from Syd to Roger to David Gilmour?</T1.3.5>
<T1.3.5.1>Mason: I've always been happy with the way it operates.</T1.3.5.1>

<T1.3.6>CNN: What do you think are some of the underrated aspects of the band?</T1.3.6>
<T1.3.6.1>Mason: To be honest, after this long and this many releases, there's not much that's been overlooked.</T1.3.6.1>

<T1.3.7>CNN: How are you guys getting along nowadays?</T1.3.7>
<T1.3.7.1>Mason: Fine, I think.</T1.3.7.1>
<T1.3.7.1.1>We haven't had any fights recently.</T1.3.7.1.1>
<T1.3.7.2>The fact of the matter is you grow up together.</T1.3.7.2>

<T1.3.8>CNN: Do you feel like sitting in with an R&B band some night?</T1.3.8>
<T1.3.8.1>Mason: Yeah.</T1.3.8.1>
<T1.3.8.1.1>I still really like playing music, and playing with other people is terrific.</T1.3.8.1.1>
<T1.3.8.1.2>I've known Bill for 35 years or something, and it was great to finally end up playing together.</T1.3.8.1.2>
