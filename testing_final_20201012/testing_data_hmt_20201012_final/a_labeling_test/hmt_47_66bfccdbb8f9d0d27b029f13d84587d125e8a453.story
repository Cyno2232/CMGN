<T1>Forty years after they were convicted by a jury of firebombing a grocery store in Wilmington, North Carolina, civil rights activists who became known as the "Wilmington 10" were pardoned Monday by the state's outgoing governor.</T1>

<T1.1>"These convictions were tainted by naked racism and represent an ugly stain on North Carolina's criminal justice system that cannot be allowed to stand any longer," said Gov.</T1.1>
<T1.1.1>"Justice demands that this stain finally be removed."</T1.1.1>

<T1.2>In 1972, nine black men and one white woman were convicted in the store firebombing in the coastal city despite their claims of innocence and their supporters' vehement argument that the defendants were victims of racially biased prosecutors.</T1.2>
<T1.2.1>Their sentences were reduced in 1978 by the state's governor then, Jim Hunt, and two years later their convictions were overturned in federal court for reasons of misconduct by the prosecutors.</T1.2.1>
<T1.2.2>But until Monday there were no pardons, and the sting of the guilty verdicts still followed the six surviving members of the group that was known nationwide as the Wilmington 10.</T1.2.2>

<T1.3>Timothy Tyson, a North Carolina historian and a visiting professor at Duke University, said he was given the notes two years ago and started to go through them recently when the NAACP called again for pardons for the Wilmington 10.</T1.3>
<T1.3.1>On the back of the legal pad, the prosecutor, Jay Stroud, had apparently written the advantages and disadvantages of a mistrial, Tyson said.</T1.3.1>
<T1.3.2>One of the advantages was a fresh start with a new jury.</T1.3.2>
<T1.3.2.1>He told the newspaper that he wanted "blacks who could be fair" on the jury.</T1.3.2.1>
<T1.3.3>Tyson said the early 1970s were "really hard and really bad" and a "bubbling cauldron" of racially heated struggles in the state.</T1.3.3>
<T1.3.3.1>North Carolina had the largest number of Ku Klux Klan members in the country, he said, but there was also a strong African-American freedom movement.</T1.3.3.1>

<T1.4>And one of the Wilmington 10 was the Rev.</T1.4>
<T1.4.1>Benjamin Chavis, whom Tyson described as a handsome, fearless civil rights leader who came from a brilliant family.</T1.4.1>
<T1.4.2>Chavis, who would become the head of the NAACP in 1993, was paroled in 1979.</T1.4.2>

<T1.5>Most of the others involved in the case struggled after they were set free.</T1.5>
<T1.5.1>"Things went badly for them," Tyson said.</T1.5.1>
<T1.5.2>"Many of them had their health broken in prison."</T1.5.2>
