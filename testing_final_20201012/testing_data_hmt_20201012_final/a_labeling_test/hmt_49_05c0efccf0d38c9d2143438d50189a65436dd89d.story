<T1>(CNN) -- Whether Moammar Gadhafi stays or goes, the turmoil-wracked country is likely to be in for more of a rough time, two Libya experts told CNN Monday.</T1>

<T1.1>"Whichever way this goes, I think there's going to be a good amount of chaos," said Diederik Vandewalle, associate professor of government at Dartmouth College.</T1.1>

<T1.2>During his 42 years in power, Gadhafi has limited the formation of political and other institutions, Vandewalle said.</T1.2>
<T1.2.1>"All civil society organizations have been eviscerated by the regime," he said.</T1.2.1>

<T1.3>In a telephone interview Monday night, he predicted more bloodshed if Gadhafi steps aside.</T1.3>
<T1.3.1>"We could see some tribal uprisings" as competing groups seek a share of Libya's oil wealth, he said, describing the likely scenario as "not very pretty."</T1.3.1>
<T1.3.2>But, he added, oil exports will likely continue after "some" interruption.</T1.3.2>
<T1.3.3>"It would be in the interest of all parties that oil keep flowing," he said, dismissing as unlikely any apocalyptic scenario in which Libya would descend into civil war.</T1.3.3>
<T1.3.4>The current uncertainty will likely be decided in the next few days, he predicted.</T1.3.4>
<T1.3.5>He called the violence against unarmed civilians "extraordinary, but not surprising from a regime that's truly entrenched."</T1.3.5>
<T1.3.5.1>There are few candidates in the wings to replace Gadhafi -- "no younger leadership able to assume that mantle of leadership," he said.</T1.3.5.1>

<T1.4>Ronald Bruce St John, who has written seven books on Libya, said Gadhafi's reign appears to be drawing quickly to a close.</T1.4>
<T1.4.1>"He's losing support by the hour from critical people in his regime," he said.</T1.4.1>
<T1.4.2>But St John said it was unlikely that the next leader would emerge from the military, since Gadhafi has long sought to keep the institution at arm's length.</T1.4.2>
<T1.4.3>Unlike Egyptians, who were seeking a more liberal system, Libyans want a new system, St John said.</T1.4.3>
<T1.4.3.1>Accomplishing that will mean "a great deal of chaos in the short term," he predicted.</T1.4.3.1>
<T1.4.4>"If he does leave, I think we'll see the tribal leadership of Libya, probably through social leadership committees, trying to come up with some kind of a nonviolent solution," he said.</T1.4.4>
<T1.4.5>St John noted that two major tribes had already withdrawn their support of Gadhafi.</T1.4.5>
<T1.4.5.1>One of them, the Warfala tribe, has long been a supporter.</T1.4.5.1>
<T1.4.5.2>The other, the Zuwayya, is one of the larger tribes of eastern Libya and is located near the terminals from where oil is exported.</T1.4.5.2>
<T1.4.6>Though another strongman could emerge, St John predicted instead that a nationwide network of "social leadership" committees set up by Gadhafi in 1993 and composed primarily of traditional leaders and tribal leaders would seek to take charge.</T1.4.6>
<T1.4.7>If Gadhafi leaves power, "those tribal leaders will try to find a way to put together some kind of a new government," he predicted.</T1.4.7>
<T1.4.7.1>"I think you'll see the tribes being the ones that will, in the short term anyway, try to find a way through the obvious chaos that's going to occur."</T1.4.7.1>

<T1.5>Sayyid Idris Al-Senussi, an exiled Libyan opposition figure who said his great-uncle was overthrown by Gadhafi, predicted that any transition would go smoothly.</T1.5>
<T1.5.1>"If Gadhafi departs, there will be no problem," he told CNN in a telephone interview from Washington.</T1.5.1>
<T1.5.1.1>"There will be a national council, which would be represented by all the tribes and all the Libyans from all different walks of life."</T1.5.1.1>
<T1.5.1.2>He said the opposition already has a constitution and a flag ready for use in the event of Gadhafi's departure.</T1.5.1.2>
<T1.5.1.3>"We will have a democracy," he predicted.</T1.5.1.3>
<T1.5.2>But Dartmouth's Vandewalle said Al-Senussi and his relatives would have little hope of gaining a position of power upon their return.</T1.5.2>
<T1.5.2.1>"It's about as likely that they'll get back in power as the Marcoses in the Philippines," he said, referring to the family of the former president of the Philippines, Ferdinand Marcos, who in 1986 fled a military rebellion and moved to Hawaii.</T1.5.2.1>
