<T1>The decision by the Atlanta-based law firm to withdraw is a victory for gay-rights supporters that have tried to have the Defense of Marriage Act repealed or tossed out on constitutional grounds in court.</T1>

<T1.1>The chairman of King & Spalding said Monday the firm's internal vetting for accepting representation was "inadequate."</T1.1>

<T1.2>As a result, the high-profile lawyer who was to lead the legal fight for House Republicans has resigned immediately from the firm.</T1.2>

<T1.3.1>Paul Clement, who was a top partner at the firm, wrote in a letter, "I resign out of the firmly held belief that a representation should not be abandoned because the client's legal position is extremely unpopular in certain quarters.</T1.3.1>
<T1.3>Defending unpopular clients is what lawyers do."</T1.3>
<T1.3.2>He will now defend the statute for another law firm.</T1.3.2>

<T1.4>The Defense of Marriage Act was passed in 1996 by the GOP-controlled Congress and signed into law by President Bill Clinton.</T1.4>
<T1.4.1>It bars federal recognition of same-sex marriages and says states cannot be forced to recognize such marriages allowed in other states.</T1.4.1>
<T1.4.2>The law defines marriage for federal purposes as unions only between a man and woman.</T1.4.2>

<T1.5>Boehner said that with the Justice Department not participating, he had "no choice" but to act unilaterally, and moved to lead the legal defense of the law.</T1.5>

<T1.6>Robert Hays Jr., chairman of King & Spalding, said the firm had filed a motion Monday to withdraw its representation of the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group of the House of Representatives, "on the constitutional issues" regarding the law.</T1.6>
<T1.6.1>"In reviewing this assignment further, I determined that the process used for vetting this engagement was inadequate," Hays said in a statement.</T1.6.1>
<T1.6.2>"Ultimately I am responsible for any mistakes that occurred and apologize for the challenges this may have created."</T1.6.2>
<T1.6.3>The Hays statement made no specific mention of the reasons behind the sudden change of heart.</T1.6.3>

<T1.7>"The Speaker is disappointed in the firm's decision and its careless disregard for its responsibilities to the House in this constitutional matter," Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck told CNN.</T1.7>
<T1.7.1>"At the same time, Mr. Clement has demonstrated legal integrity, and we are grateful for his decision to continue representing the House.</T1.7.1>
<T1.7.2>This move will ensure the constitutionality of this law is appropriately determined by the courts, rather than by the president unilaterally."</T1.7.2>
