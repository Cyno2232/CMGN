<T1>The midterm elections are a little less than seven months away.</T1>

<T1.1>Up for grabs in November's midterms is control of the U.S. Senate, where Democrats hold a 55-45 majority but are defending 21 of the 36 seats up in November, with half of those seats in red or purple states.</T1.1>
<T1.1.1>Democrats need a net gain of 17 seats this November to win back control of the Republican-led House of Representatives, a feat that political handicappers say is unlikely in part because of the shrinking number of competitive congressional districts.</T1.1.1>

<T1.2>Here are seven important dates and times between now and November that could affect the midterm elections:</T1.2>
<T1.2.1>• Mid-April: Obamacare numbers -- The Department of Health and Human Services will release its last enrollment report for the Affordable Care Act's first year, including key demographic information.</T1.2.1>
<T1.2.1.1>The key number that will affect the political arguments over Obamacare will be the percentage of younger people who have signed up for health insurance through the federal and state exchanges.</T1.2.1.1>
<T1.2.1.2>Republicans, who oppose the federal health care law, are attempting to frame the midterms as a referendum on the sweeping measure, which is President Barack Obama's signature domestic achievement.</T1.2.1.2>
<T1.2.2>• May 20: Kentucky and Georgia primaries -- Seven of the 12 Republican senators running for re-election this year did face, or still are facing, primary challenges from the right.</T1.2.2>
<T1.2.2.1>The most high-profile of that group is Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.</T1.2.2.1>
<T1.2.2.1.1>He's being challenged by Louisville businessman Matt Bevin, who enjoys the backing of some tea party groups and other conservative organizations.</T1.2.2.1.1>

<T1.2.3>• June 3: Mississippi and Iowa primaries -- Of the Republican senators facing primary challenges, Thad Cochran is the most threatened.</T1.2.3>
<T1.2.3.1>The six-term senator from Mississippi is being challenged by state lawmaker Chris McDaniel, who enjoys strong backing from conservative groups and tea party activists.</T1.2.3.1>

<T1.2.4>• Late June: All eyes will be on the Supreme Court as it is likely to issue what may be a major ruling on the Affordable Care Act.</T1.2.4>
<T1.2.4.1>The justices will rule on a lawsuit, brought against the federal government by the family-owned arts-and-crafts chain Hobby Lobby, over a requirement under the health care law that certain for-profit corporations provide contraception coverage to their workers.</T1.2.4.1>
<T1.2.4.2>At issue is whether secular, private corporations can claim a religious exemption from federal laws.</T1.2.4.2>

<T1.2.5>• June 30: The last day of June is also the last day of the second quarter of fundraising.</T1.2.5>
<T1.2.5.1>Starting July 1, campaigns and party committees begin reporting their cash hauls to the Federal Election Commission (the filings are due by July 15) and in many cases publicize their fundraising figures in the media.</T1.2.5.1>
<T1.2.5.1.1>The numbers will be scrutinized, as campaign cash is one of the key indicators of a candidate's or party's strength.</T1.2.5.1.1>

<T1.2.6>• Late summer/early fall: Some states will begin to announce how much health insurance premiums will rise in 2015 for policies acquired through the Affordable Care Act.</T1.2.6>
<T1.2.6.1>Even though health insurance premiums tend to rise every year, big jumps in premiums could damage Democrats who defend the health care law.</T1.2.6.1>

<T1.2.7>• October 3: The Labor Department releases the September unemployment report, the final jobs numbers before midterm elections.</T1.2.7>
<T1.2.7.1>While Obamacare is an important issue in the 2014 contests, the economy remains the top issue on the minds of American voters, and the top economic concern remains jobs.</T1.2.7.1>
