<T1>(CNN) --   CNN.com's  Virginia Cha spoke to HLN "Morning Express" anchor Robin Meade about overcoming anxiety and her new book, "Morning Sunshine!</T1>

<T1.1>How to Radiate Confidence and Feel It Too," published by Hachette Book Group.</T1.1>

<T1.2>HLN's Robin Meade was plagued by panic attacks early in her career.</T1.2>

<T1.3>Virginia Cha: Looking at HLN anchor Robin Meade, you would probably think she's never had a care in the world.</T1.3>
<T1.3.1>She's been a beauty queen -- no surprise -- a reporter, she's gone skydiving with the president.</T1.3.1>
<T1.3.2>In her new book, Robin shares a story of a time in her life when she actually suffered from anxiety attacks, and she talks about how she worked through her problem.</T1.3.2>
<T1.3.3>Meade: In the book I talk about how I think for a lot of people, their confidence is based upon what they perceive as their outer appearance.</T1.3.3>
<T1.3.3.1>And for me, my self-confidence was built on -- and maybe falsely so -- the feeling that people liked me.</T1.3.3.1>
<T1.3.3.2>That was my power in the world.</T1.3.3.2>
<T1.3.4>Cha: Just a few months ago you jumped out of a plane with President Bush -- former President Bush 41 for his 85th birthday, right?</T1.3.4>
<T1.3.4.1>Can you talk to us about that?</T1.3.4.1>
<T1.3.4.2>Meade: Yeah, it's funny.</T1.3.4.2>
<T1.3.4.2.1>One of the newspaper reporters asked me, "Well, if you had any anxiety issues before, didn't you have anxiety here getting ready to jump out of a plane?"</T1.3.4.2.1>
<T1.3.4.2.2>Well, lucky or unlucky for me, however you look at it, I was not able to put my mind on the actual jumping-out part because I had to think about the interview beforehand.</T1.3.4.2.2>
