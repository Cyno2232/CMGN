<T1>Full coverage of CPAC meeting on CNN political ticker</T1>

<T1.1>Without a question, it was the youth, the next generation of conservatives, who emerged from the CPAC meeting as the Big Winner.</T1.1>

<T1.2>The American Conservative Union, which put on this exhaustive three-day program, estimates that more than 10,000 people attended and 60 to 70 percent were under the age of 30.</T1.2>
<T1.2.1>It was like Spring Break for College Republicans.</T1.2.1>
<T1.2.2>The future looks bright, or at the very least, there is hope in the future for the conservative movement.</T1.2.2>

<T1.3>There were other winners and losers in my mind, so I thought I would share them with you.<T1.3>
<T1.3.1>Winner: Ron Paul Revolution</T1.3.1>
<T1.3.1.1>Texas Rep. Ron Paul was the overwhelming choice of attendees to be the 2012 Republican presidential nominee in the nonscientific, yet much discussed, CPAC Straw Poll.</T1.3.1.1>
<T1.3.2>Loser: CPAC straw poll</T1.3.2>
<T1.3.2.1>Admittedly, for political junkies like me, you can be tempted to put too much emphasis on a straw poll.</T1.3.2.1>
<T1.3.2.2>Sure, there were 10,000 attendees, but only 2,395 participated in this unscientific survey.</T1.3.2.2>
<T1.3.3>Winner: Marco Rubio</T1.3.3>
<T1.3.3.1>He was the belle of the ball at CPAC.</T1.3.3.1>
<T1.3.3.2>Rubio kicked off the conference with a speech that hit all of the boilerplate conservative themes, which drew the audience to its feet several times.</T1.3.3.2>
<T1.3.3.3>Rubio's wisest move was placing a form soliciting volunteers and donations on every seat in the ballroom before people took their seats.</T1.3.3.3>
<T1.3.4>Loser: Sarah Palin</T1.3.4>
<T1.3.4.1>A tough decision to tag the former Alaska governor with this brand, but CPAC was her crowd and she wasn't present.</T1.3.4.1>
<T1.3.4.1.1>But she missed out on an opportunity to appear before a very large and very friendly audience.</T1.3.4.1.1>
<T1.3.5>Winner: Newt Gingrich</T1.3.5>
<T1.3.5.1>The "Rocky" anthem, "Eye of the Tiger," bellowed from the sound system as Gingrich made his way through the electrified crowd.</T1.3.5.1>
<T1.3.5.1.1>Definitely memorable.</T1.3.5.1.1>
<T1.3.6>Winner: Rick Santorum</T1.3.6>
<T1.3.6.1>The former Pennsylvania senator is being singled out for his decision to shake it up a little bit during his speech.</T1.3.6.1>
<T1.3.6.2>Santorum delivered an abbreviated speech and then took questions from the audience.</T1.3.6.2>
<T1.3.6.3>Yet the former Pennsylvania senator had a pretty good showing and offered up a mea culpa to the attendees for supporting Sen. Arlen Specter's re-election in 2004.</T1.3.6.3>
<T1.3.7>Loser: Social conservatives</T1.3.7>
<T1.3.7.1>This still influential wing of the conservative movement was well represented at CPAC this year, but the immediacy of some of their top issues -- abortion, same-sex marriage and "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" in the military -- just wasn't a major part of the larger discussion.</T1.3.7.1>
<T1.3.7.2>Instead, these activists were primarily talking about fiscal discipline, lower taxes and limited government.</T1.3.7.2>
<T1.3.7.3>And GOProud, a gay conservative organization, was one of the cosponsors of CPAC.</T1.3.7.3>
<T1.3.8>Winner: Republican Party</T1.3.8>
<T1.3.8.1>A third-party conservative candidate introduced into a race will actually help the Democrats, because it will split the Republican vote.</T1.3.8.1>
<T1.3.9>Winner: Democratic Party</T1.3.9>
<T1.3.9.1>Well, I am definitely a little crazy, but this was an easy call.</T1.3.9.1>
<T1.3.9.2>Democrats got to see firsthand that conservatives are no longer lying flat on their backs after what was then thought to be a knockout blow that Obama delivered in the 2008 elections.</T1.3.9.2>
