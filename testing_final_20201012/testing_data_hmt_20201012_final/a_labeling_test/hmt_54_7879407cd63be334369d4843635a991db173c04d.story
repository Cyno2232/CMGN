<T1>(CNN) -- Spain will add the World Cup to their European title by beating the Netherlands in Sunday's final, according to Dutch football legend Johan Cruyff.</T1>

<T1.1>The 63-year-old was the leading figure in Holland's revolutionary "total football" approach in the 1970s, when he also starred for Spanish giants Barcelona for five years before managing the Catalan club from 1988 to 1996.</T1.1>

<T1.2>"Spain have always had good footballers and never a team, but now they have one," he said, as quoted by the UK Press Association.</T1.2>
<T1.2.1>"They have worked very well in the last few years and if they get into their rhythm, they should win.</T1.2.1>

<T1.3>Cruyff said coach Bert van Marwijk's unbeaten Dutch side would present a difficult challenge for the Spaniards.</T1.3>
<T1.3.1>"Holland is a very balanced team, they know their strengths and their weaknesses, and up until now they have always been able to make their strengths shine through," he said.</T1.3.1>

<T1.4>Spain must improve on their form so far if they are to become the first team in 36 years to win the European Championship and then the World Cup, according to midfielder Andres Iniesta.</T1.4>
<T1.4.1>"The initial defeat against Switzerland upset us all," Iniesta said.</T1.4.1>
<T1.4.2>"We will play better because we will probably have to if we are going to win the World Cup.</T1.4.2>
<T1.4.3>"But I have confidence in my teammates, and I think this group is able to take the final step."</T1.4.3>
<T1.4.4>Before us is the challenge of winning a World Cup.</T1.4.4>
<T1.4.4.1>"We are cautious because we know that we still have the last step, and that last step is the most difficult and the most beautiful."</T1.4.4.1>
