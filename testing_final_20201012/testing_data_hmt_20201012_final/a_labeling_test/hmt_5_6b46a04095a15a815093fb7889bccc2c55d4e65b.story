<T1>There has been just one documented example of the TTP showing more global ambitions.</T1>

<T1.1>(CNN) -- Unlike al Qaeda, the Pakistani Taliban organization has shown little appetite for taking its brand of jihadism beyond the borders of Pakistan and Afghanistan.</T1.1>
<T1.1.1>Maybe that's changing.</T1.1.1>

<T1.2>The Pakistani Taliban, also known as Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, does not lack a motive to lash out.</T1.2>
<T1.2.1>In recent months it has come under increasing pressure as the United States has intensified drone strikes and the Pakistani army has carried out offensives against the group deep inside its safe haven in Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas.</T1.2.1>

<T1.3>Officials are keeping an open mind about any link between the Taliban and the failed car bombing in New York last weekend.</T1.3>
<T1.3.1>Within hours of the incident, an audio message purportedly from Qari Hussain Mehsud (a senior member of the TTP) claimed responsibility for the attack.</T1.3.1>
<T1.3.2>"This attack is a revenge for the great and valuable martyred leaders of mujahedeen," he said.</T1.3.2>

<T1.4>Very occasionally in the past the TTP has made threats about launching attacks overseas.</T1.4>
<T1.4.1>The question for counterterrorism officials now is whether the threat by Hakimullah Mehsud to attack targets in the United States is bluster or carries real menace.</T1.4.1>
<T1.4.2>The TTP's ambitions were at first confined to the tribal territories bordering Afghanistan.</T1.4.2>
<T1.4.3>But by 2009 it was challenging Pakistan's heartlands and its establishment, with attacks on police academies, government buildings and army convoys as far away as Lahore and Rawalpindi.</T1.4.3>
<T1.4.4>On January 19, 2008, 12 Pakistanis and two Indians were arrested in Barcelona, Spain.</T1.4.4>
<T1.4.4.1>Ten were charged -- along with another suspect later detained in the Netherlands -- with involvement in a conspiracy to carry out suicide bomb attacks on Barcelona's subway system.</T1.4.4.1>
<T1.4.4.2>The 11 ultimately charged were convicted and sentenced to jail terms of eight to 10 years in December last year.</T1.4.4.2>
<T1.4.4.3>To date, the Barcelona case remains the only credible example of the TTP's capability to take its fight overseas.</T1.4.4.3>
<T1.4.4.4>But other Pakistani groups have shown an ability and desire to broaden their targets.</T1.4.4.4>
