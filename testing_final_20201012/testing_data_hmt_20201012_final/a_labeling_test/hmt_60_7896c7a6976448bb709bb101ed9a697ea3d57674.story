<T1>(CNN) -- An Australian radio show whose prank targeting Prince William's pregnant wife went horribly wrong has been taken off the air for good.</T1>

<T1.1>"The Hot30 Countdown" was suspended temporarily after the December prank, when the network expressed deep regret for the nurse who apparently committed suicide after routing through a call from the show's DJs to the royal ward.</T1.1>

<T1.2>Over the weekend, the show was permanently taken off the air.</T1.2>
<T1.2.1>The show's Facebook page directed listeners to the show's replacement called "The Bump."</T1.2.1>
<T1.2.2>In response to a user comment, the Facebook page said the two DJ's, Mel Greig and Michael Christian, "continue to have our full support and we look forward to them returning to work when the time is right!"</T1.2.2>

<T1.3>In early December, the two DJs impersonated Queen Elizabeth and Prince Charles and called King Edward VII's Hospital to gain some information about the condition of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge.</T1.3>
<T1.3.1>The pair subsequently played the prank on air.</T1.3.1>
<T1.3.2>The nurse who transferred the call through to the ward, Jacintha Saldanha, was later found dead after apparently committing suicide.</T1.3.2>
<T1.3.3>An uproar followed.</T1.3.3>

<T1.4>And the network, Southern Cross Austereo, suspended all prank calls, pulled advertising and ordered a comprehensive review of relevant policies and process.</T1.4>
<T1.4.1>Greig and Christian apologized in interviews with the Australian TV shows "A Current Affair" and "Today Tonight."</T1.4.1>
<T1.4.1.1>"There is nothing that can make me feel worse than what I feel right now," Greig said on "Today Tonight."</T1.4.1.1>

<T1.5>Off the air, Greig and Christian tweeted about the practical joke, promising "more on the #royalprank."</T1.5>
<T1.5.1>The pair's Twitter accounts were later taken down.</T1.5.1>
