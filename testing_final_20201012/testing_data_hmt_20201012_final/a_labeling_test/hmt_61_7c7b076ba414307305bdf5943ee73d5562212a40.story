<T1>(CNN) -- Manchester United's Robin van Persie received a hostile reception on his return to the Emirates Stadium but had the last laugh Sunday by scoring the equalizer in a 1-1 draw against his former club Arsenal.</T1>

<T1.1>He left Arsenal in a $37 million switch to their EPL rivals in close season and the ill-feeling surrounding that move was reflected in the chorus of boos from the home fans every time he touched the ball.</T1.1>

<T1.2>Arsenal afforded United the traditional guard of honor before the kick off, but once play got underway they showed little respect for the new champions.</T1.2>
<T1.2.1>Van Persie's sloppy ball saw Arsenal charge forward and Theo Walcott took advantage of a marginal call for offside to advance and beat David de Gea in the visiting goal.</T1.2.1>
<T1.2.2>They continued to dominate by playing with a ferocious intensity and with van Persie on the receiving end of some robust tackling, but the match turned near half-time.</T1.2.2>
<T1.2.3>First van Persie saw his point blank header kept out by Wojciech Szczesny then a mistake by Bacary Sagna let the Dutch star free and the defender responded by pulling him down in the penalty area.</T1.2.3>
<T1.2.4>Van Persie got up to coolly convert the penalty and draw United level.</T1.2.4>
<T1.2.5>United were revitalized and had the better opportunities to claim the full three points in the second half, with Wayne Rooney denied by Szczesny and substitute Ryan Giggs seeing a late effort deflected wide.</T1.2.5>

<T1.3>But the subsequent draw was a result neither team would be satisfied with and United cannot now beat Chelsea's all-time record for EPL points in a season.</T1.3>

<T1.4>As Arsenal dropped a point, Chelsea moved above them into third with a 2-0 home win over Swansea earlier Sunday.</T1.4>
