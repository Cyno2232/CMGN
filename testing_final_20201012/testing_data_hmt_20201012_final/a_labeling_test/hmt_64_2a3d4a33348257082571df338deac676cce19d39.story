<T1>(CNN) -- Should the government keep its hands off online shopping?</T1>

<T1.1>According to the massive response to our stories on a proposed Internet sales tax, many of you think so.</T1.1>

<T1.2>On Monday, the U.S. Senate approved the Marketplace Fairness Act.</T1.2>
<T1.2.1>It would allow governments to collect taxes on sales that Internet retailers, from titans such as Amazon and eBay to independent app developers, make in their state.</T1.2.1>

<T1.3>The point, supporters say, is to put traditional brick-and-mortar retailers on equal footing with digital storefronts that, in many cases, haven't been required to add tax to their prices.</T1.3>
<T1.3.1>But in an age when many of us have gotten used to one-click, 24-hour shopping on our laptops, tablets and phones, not many of the readers of our story Monday explaining the bill seemed overly excited at the prospect.</T1.3.1>

<T1.4>A lot of the objections reflected traditional political arguments.</T1.4>
<T1.4.1>Conservative-minded commenters looked at the bill not as a bid for fairness but as government digging into our wallets once again.</T1.4.1>
<T1.4.2>Added reader CactusThorn: "Politicians never saw a source of income they didn't want to tap.</T1.4.2>

<T1.5>But anti-tax arguments sometimes transcended the usual left-right battles.</T1.5>
<T1.5.1>Some comments reflected the "keep your hands off our Internet" mindset that has grown among online users who fear the impact both government and big business could have on a free and open Web.</T1.5.1>

<T1.6>In fairness, the bill as written would only tax sales by online businesses that do more than $1 million in sales annually outside states where they have physical operations.</T1.6>
<T1.6.1>That would, at least in theory, exempt digital mom-and-pop shops and the random Etsy crafter.</T1.6.1>

<T1.7>IT pro and photographer Christopher Souser replied to us on Twitter: "It wont help small businesses, it will only help large retailers.</T1.7>
<T1.7.1>Online and offline; choking out small online retailers."</T1.7.1>

<T1.8>Of course, even among engaged Web users, disdain for the plan wasn't unanimous.</T1.8>
<T1.8.1>Some people said that with e-commerce as prominent as it's become, it's only fair that states should get a cut.</T1.8.1>
<T1.8.2>Others worried about a future in which Web-based sales destroy hometown operations.</T1.8.2>
<T1.8.3>"As a small business owner (and right-leaning individual) I applaud this tax," commenter imo wrote.</T1.8.3>
<T1.8.3.1>"As a consumer it is not welcomed, but as a small business trying to compete with large corporations it absolutely levels the playing field."</T1.8.3.1>

<T1.9>For it to become a reality, the bill must now clear the Republican-controlled House and be signed by President Barack Obama.</T1.9>
<T1.9.1>It got overwhelming support from Democrats and Republicans in the Senate, but the House, much like the Internet, has been known to dance to its own tune on such matters.</T1.9.1>
