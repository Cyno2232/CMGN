<T1>(CNN) -- She was dubbed "The Assassin" after winning gold at the London 2012 Olympics, but Kaori Matsumoto prefers to be known as "Beast."</T1>

<T1.1>Her coach, however, says she is more like Peter Pan -- and the judo star herself claims she once saw a fairy like Tinker Bell.</T1.1>

<T1.2>"No-one like her has won the Olympics before," Harumi Nakahashi, Matsumoto's coach at the Four Leaf Japan Judo Club, told CNN's Human to Hero series.</T1.2>
<T1.2.1>"So I think she has made a new history in the world of judo.</T1.2.1>

<T1.3>Matsumoto, who turned 26 last month, earned her nickname not just for the ferocity of her fighting style, but also because of its unfettered natural instincts.</T1.3>
<T1.3.1>"There are tons of players in Japan who are better at judo than me, but the one thing that I can beat them at is my spirit," she says.</T1.3.1>
<T1.3.1.1>"I tend to go with just my spirit only, so my technique lags behind.</T1.3.1.1>
<T1.3.2>I'm often called 'beast' because I stay natural, and wild, I think.</T1.3.2>

<T1.4>"A judoka like her is unique in a female," Nakahashi says of Matsumoto, who at London 2012 became the first Japanese woman to win gold in the 57-kilogram class.</T1.4>
<T1.4.1>"She has a girlish side to her, but she is more like Peter Pan, with a heart of a young boy.</T1.4.1>
<T1.4.2>She has something really pure about her."</T1.4.2>

<T1.5>Matsumoto is from Kanazawa, the coastal capital of Ishikawa Prefecture which is also bordered by the Japanese Alps.</T1.5>
<T1.5.1>"I used to live where there were lots of bugs and forests and nature," she recalls.</T1.5.1>
<T1.5.2>Having started judo at the age of six, by junior high school she was traveling the world as a national representative.</T1.5.2>
<T1.5.3>"In the beginning it was that I just didn't like losing, but when I thought I want to take my parents to other countries for the matches, when the goals that were only mine started involving other people, I became stronger."</T1.5.3>
<T1.5.4>Nakahashi says Matsumoto's family "support her in a way that's invisible to the eye -- they support her soul."</T1.5.4>

<T1.6>Matsumoto was not only Japan's first female victor in her weight category, she was also the only one of the judo team to win a title at London 2012 as well as her country's first of seven gold medalists at that Olympics.</T1.6>

<T1.7>For Matsumoto, judo is a microcosm of what it means to be Japanese -- from the bow at the start of a fight, to the acknowledgement at the end.</T1.7>
<T1.7.1>"Judo's philosophy -- to start with a propriety and end with a propriety -- is Japanese spirit itself, so I think judo is something that expresses the true Japanese-ness," she says.</T1.7.1>
<T1.7.2>While there are many ways of scoring points in the sport, the ultimate goal is to achieve "Ippon" -- a decisive move which ends a contest.</T1.7.2>
<T1.7.3>Matsumoto admits one of her weaknesses is her diet, which she is trying to change in order to stop a long series of injuries to most parts of her body ("My arm, my nose, my fingers, and my elbow ... also my medial ligament, both my ankles.")</T1.7.3>
<T1.7.3.1>"Recently I've been eating a lot of organic food and stuff like that.</T1.7.3.1>

<T1.8>However, Matsumoto's mind is clearly a curious thing -- as evidenced by her admission that she believes she once saw a fairy.</T1.8>
<T1.8.1>And one time from that bucket, a tiny person this size -- like Tinker Bell without the wings -- came out and flew away.</T1.8.1>

<T1.9>While Matsumoto is aiming to defend her title at Rio 2016, an appearance at her home Olympics in Tokyo four years later may be a less likely dream -- but not for younger generations of judo hopefuls.</T1.9>
<T1.9.1>"But by watching sports together through the Olympic Games, we can share our dreams with the children.</T1.9.1>
<T1.9.1.1>And the more children share those dreams, the more they will be able to have their own."</T1.9.1.1>
<T1.9.2>Smile, and the whole world smiles with you -- even if you're a "beast."</T1.9.2>
