<T1>Nearly 4 million children who have at least one parent who entered the U.S. illegally were born in the United States and are U.S. citizens as a result, according to the study conducted by the Pew Hispanic Center.</T1>

<T1.1>(CNN) -- Julie Quiroz, a 14-year-old U.S. citizen, has been separated from her mother for nearly two years.</T1.1>
<T1.1.1>Her mom was deported to Mexico for being in the United States illegally.</T1.1.1>
<T1.1.2>"It's really, really hard to leave your family," she told CNN by phone.</T1.1.2>

<T1.2>That's about three quarters of the estimated 5.5 million children of illegal immigrants inside the United States, according to the study.</T1.2>

<T1.3>About 1.8 million children of undocumented immigrants live in poverty, the study found.</T1.3>
<T1.3.1>"Among children whose parents are unauthorized immigrants, one in three is poor.</T1.3.1>
<T1.3.2>The [poverty] rate of children of unauthorized immigrants is similar whether the children are unauthorized immigrants or U.S. born," the study says.</T1.3.2>

<T1.4>Roughly 12 million illegal immigrants are in the United States -- about 4 percent of the nation's population.</T1.4>
<T1.4.1>The study found that the majority of illegal immigrants, about 7 million, come from Mexico.</T1.4.1>
<T1.4.2>Shuya Ohno with the Washington-based advocacy organization National Immigration Forum said the study underscores how the nation's immigration situation is "not so simple."</T1.4.2>
<T1.4.2.1>"This really highlights the fact that so many undocumented families are of mixed status -- that there is a U.S. citizen in the direct family," he said.</T1.4.2.1>
<T1.4.2.2>Undocumented immigrants make up more than 5 percent of the U.S. work force, according to the study, based on March 2008 figures from the U.S. Census Bureau.</T1.4.2.2>
<T1.4.2.3>In states near Mexico's border -- Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada and Texas -- about 10 percent of the student population are the children of illegal immigrants.</T1.4.2.3>
<T1.4.2.3.1>"The vast majority of all children with at least one unauthorized immigrant parent live in two-parent families (80 percent)," the study says.</T1.4.2.3.1>
<T1.4.2.3.2>"This is similar to the share of children of other immigrants who do so (84 percent) and higher than the share of children with U.S.-born parents (71 percent)."</T1.4.2.3.2>

<T1.5>In the case of Julie Quiroz, she was born in Washington state, lived there her entire life and went to school there.</T1.5>
<T1.5.1>"She is getting no education or very little -- and pretty much has lost all of her English language skills for being out of the country now for almost two years.</T1.5.1>
<T1.5.1.1>It's just awful," said Joe Kennard, the philanthropist who came to Julie's aid.</T1.5.1.1>
<T1.5.2>Kennard formed a group called Organization to Help Citizen Children, which works with churches along the U.S.-Mexico border to provide support for children whose mother or father is deported to Mexico.</T1.5.2>
<T1.5.3>Immigration officials have long maintained they are simply enforcing the laws on the books and it's the fault of the parents for putting children into such a predicament by not following proper immigration channels.</T1.5.3>
<T1.5.4>She said she hopes to  be a lawyer for immigrants one day "to help make their dreams come true, to make a better life here."</T1.5.4>
<T1.5.4.1>Her message to citizen children: "Stay strong.</T1.5.4.1>
