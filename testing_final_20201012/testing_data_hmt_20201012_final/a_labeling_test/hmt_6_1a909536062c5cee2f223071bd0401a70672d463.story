<T1>Lille, France (CNN)Former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn conceded Wednesday that his approach to sex is rougher than that of most men, as he took the stand for a second day in his trial in France on aggravated pimping charges.</T1>

<T1.1>His words followed testimony from two sex workers about his behavior at sex parties he's accused of organizing or encouraging in Europe and the United States.</T1.1>
<T1.1.1>He denies knowing that the women involved in the parties were prostitutes.</T1.1.1>
<T1.1.2>One, named only as Mounia R., told the court in the northern French city of Lille that Strauss-Kahn had "brutal" sexual relations with her and must have known she was being paid.</T1.1.2>
<T1.1.3>A second, named as Jade, told the court that she had been subjected to an "unsolicited" sexual act by Strauss-Kahn -- who's commonly known by his initials, DSK -- after going to a party at the Tantra sex club in Belgium.</T1.1.3>

<T1.2>"Through this trial, I am discovering that my sexuality is perhaps rougher than most men's sexuality.</T1.2>
<T1.2.1>If some women don't like it, it's their right.</T1.2.1>
<T1.2.2>But my behavior is the same with all women," Strauss-Kahn said.</T1.2.2>


<T1.3>But the crux of his defense is that he did not know prostitutes were involved.</T1.3>

<T1.4>Both Mounia R. and Jade are plaintiffs in the case.</T1.4>
<T1.4.1>Jade told the court she had refused to have sex with Strauss-Kahn at the Tantra club, "because it was a butchery."</T1.4.1>
<T1.4.2>She had previously met Strauss-Kahn at a hotel in Paris, Jade said, when he was the only man surrounded by other women in a bed.</T1.4.2>
<T1.4.3>He did not speak to her but treated her "like an object, not as a human being."</T1.4.3>
<T1.4.4>Jade later went on a trip to Washington, D.C. as part of a group accompanying Strauss-Kahn, the court heard.</T1.4.4>
<T1.4.4.1>She did not sleep with Strauss-Kahn on that trip, she said.</T1.4.4.1>
<T1.4.4.2>He approached another woman in the group for sex but was turned down.</T1.4.4.2>

<T1.5>The court also heard excerpts of testimony given previously by two other sex workers, named as Estelle and Marion, who joined a second trip to Washington with Strauss-Kahn.</T1.5>
<T1.5.1>Estelle alleged that Strauss-Kahn had asked to see her without Paszkowski's group and had inquired about her fees.</T1.5.1>
<T1.5.1.1>He said that if money was mentioned, it was just to cover her travel expenses.</T1.5.1.1>
<T1.5.1.2>The two women had been introduced to Strauss-Kahn as secretaries working for a construction company at which another defendant in the case, businessman David Roquet, was employed.</T1.5.1.2>
<T1.5.1.3>According to excerpts read out by a magistrate, a witness who was part of that second trip to Washington said he had doubts about the professions of Estelle and Marion after spending time with them.</T1.5.1.3>
<T1.5.1.3.1>The next day he allegedly told Paszkowski: "You are not going to make me believe they were secretaries.</T1.5.1.3.1>
<T1.5.1.3.2>Never do this again to me!"</T1.5.1.3.2>
<T1.5.2>Strauss-Kahn: I didn't know there were prostitutes at sex parties</T1.5.2>

<T1.6>"But I don't consider myself as the organizer of any party whatsoever," he said, adding that he had never asked anyone to organize parties for him.</T1.6>
<T1.6.1>Two women who accompanied Strauss-Kahn on a third trip to Washington said they considered themselves libertines, not prostitutes, but would not turn down a "present."</T1.6.1>
<T1.6.1.1>Unlike other women in this case, Helene and Florence said they didn't perceive any brutality or deviance at the parties.</T1.6.1.1>
<T1.6.1.2>Late Wednesday, a woman named Ines recalled hearing Strauss-Kahn say he "loathed whores."</T1.6.1.2>
<T1.6.2>Sex workers involved in the parties said they were like orgies.</T1.6.2>
<T1.6.2.1>In France, prostitution is legal, but pimping is not.</T1.6.2.1>
<T1.6.3>He also spoke of his dislike for prostitution and the risks that he considered using prostitutes would pose in terms of his political ambitions.</T1.6.3>
