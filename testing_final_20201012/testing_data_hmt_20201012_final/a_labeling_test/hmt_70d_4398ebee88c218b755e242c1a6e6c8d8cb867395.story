<T1>Bariloche, Argentina (CNN) -- During a visit to Argentina 11 years ago, Elena Durón Miranda was horrified to see children as young as 3 years old rummaging through a trash dump for food and valuable materials.</T1>

<T1.1>Durón Miranda learned that many children in Bariloche, a popular city for skiers and tourists in southern Argentina, drop out of school and spend their lives working at the dump.</T1.1>

<T1.2>Determined to restore their dignity, Durón Miranda decided to stay in the country and start a nonprofit called PETISOS, which stands for Prevención y Erradicación del Trabajo Infantil SOS (Prevention and Eradication of Child Labor SOS).</T1.2>
<T1.2.1>The organization aims to provide children with free education and extracurricular programs so they have an alternative to working.</T1.2.1>
<T1.2.2>Today, approximately 200 boys and girls in Bariloche benefit from PETISOS.</T1.2.2>

<T1.3>When she was starting, Durón Miranda first set out to understand what was leading the children to work in the dump.</T1.3>
<T1.3.1>"I wanted to know what would lead a family to let this happen," she said.</T1.3.1>

<T1.4>While Argentina has laws against child labor, the majority of working children do so for their families as unpaid laborers, according to the International Labor Organization.</T1.4>
<T1.4.1>Parents don't force their children to work, but the children join in at an early age because work activities often revolve around family networks.</T1.4.1>
<T1.4.2>"All parents want a better life for their children than what they had," Durón Miranda said.</T1.4.2>

<T1.5>PETISOS programs are open to anyone in the community, working or nonworking.</T1.5>
<T1.5.1>But involving a working child can be a lengthy process.</T1.5.1>
<T1.5.2>"We tell them that a child that has more years of schooling has the opportunity to get a better job and eventually (make) more money than (they make) doing subsistence work."</T1.5.2>

<T1.6>PETISOS has a team of professionals and volunteers working with the children to ensure their growth.</T1.6>
<T1.6.1>There are afterschool workshops held at the PETISOS headquarters, where children can get help with their homework or do art projects.</T1.6.1>
<T1.6.2>And psychologists, doctors and social workers are also available to work with the children and their families.</T1.6.2>
<T1.6.3>Family heads can also receive job training and child-rearing support.</T1.6.3>
<T1.6.4>Oftentimes, there are several children from the same family in the PETISOS program.</T1.6.4>
<T1.6.5>Rosa Del Carmen Aguilar is a single mother of seven who used to work in the garbage dump to provide for her family.</T1.6.5>
<T1.6.5.1>Durón Miranda's programs helped Aguilar get out of the dump and keep her children out of trouble.</T1.6.5.1>

<T1.7>The group is funded by grants and donations.</T1.7>

<T1.8>As a result of PETISOS efforts, many children have gone on to graduate from high school and attend college.</T1.8>
<T1.8.1>There are others who are working stable jobs, and many young women have started families and are more sensitive to the upbringing of their children.</T1.8.1>

<T1.9>Durón Miranda describes her job as "full-life" rather than "full-time," but she said she can't imagine it any other way.</T1.9>
<T1.9.1>"The problems these boys and girls are living, and which we spend all our time on, are very painful," she said.</T1.9.1>
<T1.9.2>"Fortunately, we have the capacity to transform pain into the desire to do something about it."</T1.9.2>
