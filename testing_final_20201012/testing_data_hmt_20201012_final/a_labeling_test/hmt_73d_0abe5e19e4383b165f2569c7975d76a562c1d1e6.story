<T1.2>Josias Krumpf, 83, lived for years after the war in Racine, Wisconsin.</T1.2>

<T1.3>The United States revoked his citizenship in 2005 after the Criminal Division of the U.S. Department of Justice sought to denaturalize him.</T1.3>
<T1.3.1>Acting Assistant Attorney General Rita Glavin announced Krumpf's deportation Thursday.</T1.3.1>

<T1.4>The United States removed Krumpf because of his participation in that and other Nazi-sponsored acts of persecution during the war, Glavin said.</T1.4>

<T1.5>Krumpf admits standing watch on November 3, 1943, as SS guards at the Trawniki Labor Camp in Poland shot and killed 8,000 Jews, including women and 400 children, in pits.</T1.5>
<T1.5.1>Glavin said Krumpf said he had orders to shoot any prisoners who survived.</T1.5.1>
<T1.5.2>Krumpf also served as an SS guard at the Nazi-run Sachsenhausen Concentration Camp in Germany and at slave labor sites in Nazi-occupied France, where prisoners under his watch built launching platforms for German missile attacks on England, Glavin said.</T1.5.2>

<T1.6>His removal to Austria is part of an effort by several U.S. government departments and law enforcement agencies to identify and prosecute participants in Nazi crimes of persecution who live in the United States, the Justice Department said.</T1.6>
