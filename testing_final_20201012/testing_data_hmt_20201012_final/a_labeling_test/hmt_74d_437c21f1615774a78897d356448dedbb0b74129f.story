<T1>Athens (CNN) -- The leader of Greece's extreme right wing Golden Dawn party and four party lawmakers were charged Sunday with forming and participating in a criminal gang.</T1>

<T1.1>Nikos Michaloliakos and the other four -- all members of parliament -- left the Athens prosecutor's office in handcuffs, escorted by counterterrorism officers in bullet proof vests and balaclavas.</T1.1>
<T1.1.1>It is the first time since the restoration of democracy in 1974, following a seven-year junta, that a party leader and members of parliament have been arrested.</T1.1.1>

<T1.2>Michaloliakos' arrests and those of the lawmakers -- Elias Kassidiaris, Elias Panagiotaros, Ioannis Lagos and Nikos Mihos -- are part of a crackdown following a controversial stabbing death.</T1.2>

<T1.3>Pavlos Fyssas, a popular anti-fascist figure and well-known hip-hop artist with the stage name Killah P, was the victim of the knife attack that was allegedly committed by a Golden Dawn supporter.</T1.3>
<T1.3.1>Clashes broke out in a working-class Athens suburb this month, as Fyssas' death inflamed already growing concerns about the rising influence of Golden Dawn.</T1.3.1>

<T1.4>The ultranationalist, anti-immigration party has been linked by critics to street violence and neo-Nazism.</T1.4>

<T1.5>Kassidiaris denied his party's involvement in Fyssas' death, calling it a "heinous crime."</T1.5>

<T1.6>Deputy Prime Minister Evangelos Venizelos, whose socialist Pasok party is part of the governing coalition, said Golden Dawn "must be dealt with as a criminal organization."</T1.6>
<T1.6.1>In 2012, the party rode a wave of dissatisfaction among some Greeks over internationally imposed austerity measures amid the country's deep financial crisis, winning 7% of the vote and gaining seats in parliament for the first time.</T1.6.1>
<T1.6.2>Recent polls had seen support rise as high as 12%.</T1.6.2>
