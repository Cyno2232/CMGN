<T1>Looking slightly wan but smiling, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, left a hospital Thursday morning, three days after being admitted for acute morning sickness.</T1>

<T1.2>A St. James's Palace spokesman said: "The Duchess of Cambridge has been discharged from the King Edward VII Hospital and will now head to Kensington Palace for a period of rest.‬‪</T1.2>
<T1.2.1>"Their Royal Highnesses would like to thank the staff at the hospital for the care and treatment the Duchess has received."</T1.2.1>

<T1.3>In his first public comments since then, Prince Charles, the heir to the British throne, said he was "thrilled" by the news.</T1.3>
<T1.3.1>"It's a very nice thought to become a grandfather in my old age, if I can say so," he told reporters in London.</T1.3.1>

<T1.4>William and Catherine's child will be next in line to the British throne after William, regardless of whether it is a boy or a girl.</T1.4>
