<T1>But as the U.S. marks Thursday's anniversary of the National Minimum Drinking Age Act, Heath and some other scholars still dare to ask an unpopular question: Would America be better served by reducing its drinking age -- or at least encouraging states to set their own limits?</T1>

<T1.1>Thirty years ago this week, Congress passed a bill that effectively raised the national drinking age to 21.</T1.1>
<T1.1.1>Despite subsequent efforts to lower it in some states -- and the fact that most developed countries allow young people to legally drink at 18 -- that threshold has remained firmly in place ever since.</T1.1.1>

<T1.2>Proponents of the higher drinking age says it reduces traffic fatalities and alcohol-related accidents while keeping booze out of the hands of teens, whose brains are still developing.</T1.2>

<T1.3>The World Health Organization cites the U.S. as one of only a handful of developed countries -- Iceland, Japan, South Korea and Thailand are others -- with a minimum drinking age over 18.</T1.3>
<T1.3.1>Several countries, including Belgium, Denmark and Germany, even allow 16-year-olds to buy beer and wine.</T1.3.1>
<T1.3.2>"I think 18 is viewed (by most countries) pretty much as a reasonable age limit," said Marjana Martinic, deputy president of the International Center for Alcohol Policies or ICAP.</T1.3.2>

<T1.4>But in the wide-lapeled 1970s, things were very different.</T1.4>
<T1.4.1>After Congress in 1971 dropped the voting age from 21 to 18, many states followed suit by lowering decades-old barriers to drinking.</T1.4.1>
<T1.4.1.1>The rationale went something like this: If young Americans could be entrusted to vote, serve on a jury and fight in Vietnam, why couldn't they order a beer?</T1.4.1.1>
<T1.4.2>By the late 1970s, more than half the states in the U.S. had lowered their minimum drinking ages, usually from 21 to 18.</T1.4.2>
<T1.4.3>But when research showed an increase in traffic fatalities in these states, state legislatures began to reverse course.</T1.4.3>
<T1.4.3.1>Mothers Against Drunk Driving, founded in 1980, quickly gained national clout and lobbied lawmakers to raise the legal limit.</T1.4.3.1>
<T1.4.4>By 1995, faced with this strong financial incentive and pressure from MADD, all 50 states and the District of Columbia had complied.</T1.4.4>

<T1.5>"Minimum legal drinking age laws have proven to be a very effective and important countermeasure for reducing drunk driving when younger drivers are involved," said the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration in a statement.</T1.5>
<T1.5.1>When the law was raised to 21, alcohol-related deaths for young people decreased; when the drinking age was lowered, deaths increased."</T1.5.1>

<T1.6>There's a movement to lower legal drinking ages in the U.S., and its leader is not a college student or a brewery owner.</T1.6>
<T1.6.1>He's a university president.</T1.6.1>
<T1.6.2>Why should we be expected to enforce a law that's ignored by 70 percent of students before they even come (to college)?"</T1.6.2>
<T1.6.3>CNN Opinion: Get real, lower drinking age to 19</T1.6.3>
<T1.6.3.1>Instead, he argues, colleges should be given the chance to educate students on how to drink responsibly, within campus boundaries and out in the open.</T1.6.3.1>

<T1.7>Experts say lowering the drinking age remains a tough sell to politicians worried about re-election.</T1.7>
<T1.7.1>"There isn't much appetite to change something that appears to be working," said Martinic of ICAP.</T1.7.1>
<T1.7.1.1>"It's not a very popular issue and it could potentially be damaging to a politician to advocate for a lower age, because nobody wants more traffic accidents.</T1.7.1.1>
<T1.7.2>And he proposes that American teens be eligible for an alcohol permit -- not unlike a driver's license -- upon turning 18, graduating from high school and completing an alcohol-education course.</T1.7.2>
<T1.7.2.1>They would need the permit to buy beer, wine or liquor, and the state could revoke the permit for those convicted of alcohol-related offenses such as drunk driving.</T1.7.2.1>

<T1.8>By contrast, where it's banned until age 21, there's something of the 'forbidden fruit' syndrome."</T1.8>
