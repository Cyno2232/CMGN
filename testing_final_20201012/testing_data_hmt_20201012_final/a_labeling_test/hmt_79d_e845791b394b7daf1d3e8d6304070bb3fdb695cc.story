<T1>(CNN)As expected, the radical left party Syriza was the big winner of the Greek elections, coming only two seats short of an absolute majority in parliament.</T1>

<T1.1>But it's unclear if new Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras will be able to effectively pursue his anti-austerity agenda and renegotiate the terms of the Greek bailout with creditors -- and he will surely need to make a number of concessions to its coalition partners, the Independent Greeks, a right-wing anti-immigration party.</T1.1>

<T1.2>What does this victory mean for Greece and for the debt-ridden countries of southern Europe?</T1.2>
<T1.2.1>For Greece, this is a decisive step in the demise of PASOK and New Democracy, the parties that have been in power for 40 years.</T1.2.1>
<T1.2.2>Secondly, it shows the failure of the political strategy pursued by the Troika (the European Central Bank, IMF and European Commission) to implement austerity in southern Europe by relying on centrist parties to form a cartel that is insulated from voters.</T1.2.2>

<T1.3>Austerity is of course the main culprit for the death of traditional politics in Greece.</T1.3>
<T1.3.1>This is mainly because it has undermined the system of mass party patronage on which the two traditional big parties on the center-left (PASOK) and center-right (New Democracy) have relied on to alternate in power.</T1.3.1>

<T1.4>"Pork barrel politics," as it is known, has long been the cornerstone of Greek politics -- and also one of the causes of the deep economic problems it is facing now.</T1.4>
<T1.4.1>This immensely costly system was able to survive at the cost of high inflation and currency devaluations (before the euro) or mounting public debt (since Greece's entry into the euro).</T1.4.1>
<T1.4.2>But when the interest rates on government bonds shot up and debt could no longer be used to finance the spoils system, Greece was taken to the brink of bankruptcy.</T1.4.2>

<T1.5>The victory of Syriza also signals the broader failure of the political strategy that has been employed to implement austerity in the debt-ridden countries of southern Europe -- a strategy best described as "cartel politics".</T1.5>
<T1.5.1>Cartel politics involves the formation of political alliances between the ruling centrist parties to implement austerity.</T1.5.1>
<T1.5.2>Forming political cartels is understandable in a context where any party in office is bound to have to pass unpopular policies (spending cuts, tax hikes) imposed by creditors that will cost votes and alienate a sizable share of the electorate.</T1.5.2>
<T1.5.2.1>It is a good way to stay in office in the short term, but it is a terrible way to keep votes in the medium and long term, because no choice is presented to citizens.</T1.5.2.1>

<T1.6>Syriza is the first challenger to break the Greek political cartel.</T1.6>
<T1.6.1>Greece may be a special case because of the extent of its economic collapse, but other movements elsewhere are also looming on the horizon.</T1.6.1>

<T1.7>Others will surge if politicians continue to believe that democracy can be put on hold to satisfy markets.</T1.7>
