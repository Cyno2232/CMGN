<T1>Chris Christie built his keynote address to the Republican National Convention on the theme of telling tough truths to the nation.</T1>

<T1.1>"We have become paralyzed by our desire to be loved," announced Christie, showing off the gruff, no-nonsense style that catapulted him into the governor's mansion.</T1.1>
<T1.1.1>It's only fair to mention some tough truths about his speech, his tenure as governor and the state of the Republican campaign for president.</T1.1.1>

<T1.2>The most striking truth (as Democrats pointed out even before the address) is that New Jersey under Christie has suffered from a severely troubled economy and soaring costs of government: the very things that Republicans like Christie blame on Democrats.</T1.2>
<T1.2.1>As of July, New Jersey's unemployment rate stands at 9.8%: higher than the national average, fourth worst among the 50 states and the highest level in 35 years.</T1.2.1>
<T1.2.1.1>The rate is higher than on the day Christie took office in 2010 and nearly a full percentage point higher than earlier this year, when Christie's State of the State address exultantly and repeatedly claimed that a "New Jersey Comeback" was under way.</T1.2.1.1>
<T1.2.2>And despite Christie's boasts about trimming the cost of government in the Garden State -- the keynote speech repeated his frequent claim of balancing three state budgets -- some fiscal watchdogs attribute the budgets to creative accounting, not true cost containment.</T1.2.2>

<T1.3>Most important, from a political perspective, Christie had a smooth launch onto the national stage, talking more about Chris Christie -- much more -- than about the man of the hour, candidate Mitt Romney.</T1.3>
<T1.3.1>In the seven-page text of the address sent to reporters, Romney's name doesn't appear until near the bottom of page five.</T1.3.1>
<T1.3.2>Though Obama called Kerry's name 13 times in that speech, Christie mentioned Romney only seven times.</T1.3.2>
