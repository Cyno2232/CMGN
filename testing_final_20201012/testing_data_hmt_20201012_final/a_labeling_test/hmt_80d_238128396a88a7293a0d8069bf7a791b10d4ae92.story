<T1>(CNN) -- A Brazilian court ordered Wednesday that 9-year-old Sean Goldman be returned to the custody of his father, David, in the United States, but his Brazilian relatives were expected to try to block the order, a Brazilian official said.</T1>

<T1.1>Outside his home in New Jersey, David Goldman told reporters he was heartened by the news, but would not consider his efforts successful until he and the boy are reunited.</T1.1>

<T1.2>"I'm hopeful," he said.</T1.2>
<T1.2.1>"I can't be optimistic because I've gone down there so many times, always under the guise that the rule of law will be followed and Sean will come home to me and his family, and that doesn't happen."</T1.2.1>

<T1.3>The Supreme Court could still allow Sean Goldman to be returned to his father in the United States while it decides any appeal.</T1.3>

<T1.4>The case began in 2004, when his wife, Bruna Bianchi, took their 4-year-old son from their home in New Jersey to Rio de Janeiro for what was to have been a two-week vacation.</T1.4>
<T1.4.1>She never returned, instead remarrying there and retaining custody of their son.</T1.4.1>
<T1.4.2>She died last year in childbirth.</T1.4.2>

<T1.5>The case has drawn high-profile input, including pressure for the boy's return from Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who said Wednesday in a statement that she was pleased to hear about the decision.</T1.5>
<T1.5.1>"And it is my hope that this long legal process is now complete and that the Goldman family will be reunited quickly."</T1.5.1>
