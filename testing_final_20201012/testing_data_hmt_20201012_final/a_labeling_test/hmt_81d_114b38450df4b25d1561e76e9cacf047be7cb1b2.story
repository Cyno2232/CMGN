<T1.1>According to the Library of Congress, more than 80 percent of American movies from 1893-1930 -- also known as the "silent era" -- no longer exist in the United States.</T1.1>

<T1.2>Many of the films sat in storage, making it possible for them to be preserved for restoration today.</T1.2>

<T1.3>Caroline Frick, curator of motion pictures at the George Eastman House museum of photography and film in Rochester, New York, said such film repatriation projects are exciting, with "a huge array of film history that still remains unknown because so many of the films don't exist."</T1.3>
