<T1>BOGOTA, Colombia (CNN) -- Colombian police have killed a drug trafficker who the government says is one of the most sought-after fugitive outside the country's rebel leaders.</T1>

<T1.1>Victor Manuel Mejia Munera was a drug lord with ties to paramilitary groups, the Colombian government says.</T1.1>
<T1.1.1>Victor Manuel Mejia Munera and two bodyguards were killed Tuesday when police tracked them down on a farm in the northwestern province of Antioquia, according to a statement on the Colombian presidency Web site.</T1.1.1>

<T1.2.1>Mejia Munera was wearing an American-style, desert-camouflage uniform when he was killed, said Colombian Defense Minister Juan Manuel Santos.</T1.2.1>
<T1.2>Mejia Munera also had short- and long-range weapons with ammunition, the presidential statement said.</T1.2>

<T1.3>"This is a great strike of the Public Force against the criminal structures of the country," Santos said, warning that drug traffickers who do not turn themselves over to the government will "end up in the jail or in a tomb."</T1.3>

<T1.4>Mejia Munera is not alleged to have ties to FARC, but he had been involved with a right-wing paramilitary group known as United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, according to the U.S. State Department.</T1.4>

<T1.5.2>Mejia Munera and his brother, Miguel Angel Mejia Munera, known as "Los Mellizos," or "the Twins," have been accused of running major drug rings in Colombia.</T1.5.2>
<T1.5.2.1>The brothers also have faced narcotics-trafficking charges in the United States.</T1.5.2.1>
<T1.5>Santos initially told reporters that police had killed Miguel Angel Mejia Munera.</T1.5>
<T1.5.1>The Colombian presidency later said the slain drug lord was actually Victor Manuel Mejia Munera.</T1.5.1>
<T1.5.3>The U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control reported that the brothers have been involved in narcotics trafficking since the early 1990s, when they were guarding ships carrying cocaine from western Colombia to Mexico.</T1.5.3>
