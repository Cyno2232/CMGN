<T1>Lionfish are causing a huge strain on his business and the wider commercial fishing industry in Florida, devouring other fish populations -- in some cases reducing them by up to 90%.</T1>

<T1.1>According to the Florida's Department for Environmental Protection, lionfish are native to the Indian and Pacific Oceans, but were accidentally introduced into Atlantic and Caribbean waters during the 1990s.</T1.1>
<T1.1.1>With no natural predators in the Atlantic and an ability to reproduce year-round, their numbers have risen unabated in recent years.</T1.1.1>

<T1.2>Not only are lionfish causing grief for lobster fishermen like Nichols, they are also threatening to upset the balance of the fragile reef ecosystem.</T1.2>
<T1.2.1>"What we've found through stomach analysis and working with fish that have been collected is that they are consuming a wide variety of prey," said Lad Akins, director of special projects for REEF, a marine conservation group.</T1.2.1>
<T1.2.2>Ecologically important species like mudfish which graze on algae, stopping it growing over the reefs, are also being impacted, he says.</T1.2.2>
<T1.2.3>"I'm an optimist but potential impacts of lionfish could result in major shifts in the ecology of our Caribbean and West Atlantic reef barriers," Akins said.</T1.2.3>

<T1.3>In an effort to minimize their impact, REEF run a monthly contest, open to both businesses and individuals, awarding prizes to those who catch the most lionfish.</T1.3>
<T1.3.1>It also run workshops educating divers about safe collection and removal techniques.</T1.3.1>
<T1.3.2>The U.S.'s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has also joined the fight with a campaign that encourages people to eat lionfish.</T1.3.2>
