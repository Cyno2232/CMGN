<T1>(CNN) -- Once Usain Bolt got out of the starting blocks, no one was going to beat him at the world championships.</T1>

<T1.1>Two years ago at the worlds, the Jamaican false started in the 100-meter final and was disqualified.</T1.1>
<T1.1.1>His countryman and training partner, Yohan Blake, took advantage to claim gold in Daegu, South Korea.</T1.1.1>

<T1.2>There was no false start for Bolt on Sunday in rainy Moscow and he captured his second world title in the 100 meters.</T1.2>
<T1.2.1>His time of 9.77 seconds was well off his world record of 9.58 seconds but still good enough to comfortably beat American Justin Gatlin and Jamaican Nesta Carter.</T1.2.1>

<T1.3>Bolt now owns six world championship gold medals to go along with six gold medals at the Olympics.</T1.3>

<T1.4>Perhaps mindful of what happened in South Korea, Bolt's start was cautious and Gatlin led him early.</T1.4>
<T1.4.1>But after getting fully into his stride, Bolt -- despite not feeling at his best -- eased past Gatlin and coasted home.</T1.4.1>

<T1.5>Bolt last year called himself a "living legend" and the result in Moscow on Sunday won't diminish his confidence.</T1.5>
<T1.5.1>It likely also lifted Jamaican sport.</T1.5.1>

<T1.6>With sprinters thus under scrutiny, Bolt spoke up in July and said: "I know I am clean."</T1.6>
