<T1>Scott Brown, the former senator from Massachusetts who moved to New Hampshire to run in a more friendly environment, appears to be in a dead heat with Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a new poll shows.</T1>

<T1.1>A CNN/ORC International poll out Monday finds Shaheen and Brown tied among likely voters, with both obtaining the support of 48% among 735 voters surveyed.</T1.1>

<T1.2.3.1>His rating currently sits at 46%.</T1.2.3.1>
