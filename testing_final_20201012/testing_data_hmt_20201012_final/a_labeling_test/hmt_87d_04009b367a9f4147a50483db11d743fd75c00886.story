<T1>(CNN) -- Call it a meteorological mystery: Forecasters warned that there would be at least six Atlantic hurricanes this season, but so far we've seen only one.</T1>

<T1.1>It's the first year in recent memory that every major hurricane forecast has busted after pointing to "above normal activity."</T1.1>

<T1.2>2013's first hurricane -- Humberto -- was a month late.</T1.2>

<T1.3>Although the number of 2013 Atlantic storms is above average -- at nine so far -- the intensity of those storms hasn't matched the forecasts.</T1.3>

<T1.4>Experts don't have a full understanding, but three things are getting the blame:</T1.4>
<T1.4.1>--In the eastern Atlantic, where hurricanes are often born, African desert air is drying the moisture that hurricanes need to form.</T1.4.1>
<T1.4.2>--In the western Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, fast horizontal winds have been cutting off the tops of potential hurricanes, sapping their power.</T1.4.2>
<T1.4.3>--Experts speculate that dry air from Brazil's drought may be another factor.</T1.4.3>

<T1.5>Even with the most sophisticated prediction techniques, Gray says, "there's still 40 or 50% of variations in tropical storm and hurricane activity that we can't explain."</T1.5>

<T1.6>The NWS -- last May -- initially forecast 13 to 20 "named storms," including seven to 11 hurricanes.</T1.6>
<T1.6.1>Then in August, it dialed down that initial forecast to predict 13 to 19 named storms, including six to nine hurricanes.</T1.6.1>
<T1.6.2>So far, including Humberto, we've seen nine named storms.</T1.6.2>

<T1.7>"Historically speaking, June and July and the first part of August are typically fairly quiet," he says.</T1.7>
<T1.7.1>September, he warns, is the time when storms can start to get get serious.</T1.7.1>

<T1.8>Hurricane watchers point out that there are more signs that something may be amiss:</T1.8>
<T1.8.1>--The Accumulated Cyclone Energy index -- a rating system that compares the intensity of storm seasons -- would normally be around 55 for the Atlantic.</T1.8.1>
<T1.8.1.1>It's now a paltry 16.</T1.8.1.1>
<T1.8.1.2>Globally the rating is a stunning 255, roughly half of what we should see this time of year.</T1.8.1.2>
<T1.8.2>--When an ocean basin kicks up a fuss on one part of the globe, usually another ocean basin is quiet.</T1.8.2>
<T1.8.2.1>This year, according to the ratings, storm activity in all the world's ocean basins is below normal.</T1.8.2.1>
<T1.8.3>--This year there is no El Niño, which would keep the season quiet, or La Niña, which would fuel a more active season.</T1.8.3>
<T1.8.3.1>Atlantic surface temperatures continue to be above normal, which also would help stir up storms.</T1.8.3.1>
<T1.8.4>--Climate change?</T1.8.4>
<T1.8.4.1>As you might expect, opinions differ.</T1.8.4.1>
<T1.8.4.1.1>Some researchers say global warming from the buildup of CO2 carbon gas pollution in the atmosphere will lead to more frequent and more powerful hurricanes.</T1.8.4.1.1>
<T1.8.4.1.2>Some studies support that hypothesis, while others are less convinced.</T1.8.4.1.2>
