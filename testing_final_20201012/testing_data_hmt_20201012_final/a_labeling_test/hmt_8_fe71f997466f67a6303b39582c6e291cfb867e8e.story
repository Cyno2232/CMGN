<T1>(CNN) -- Former Weather Underground militant Bill Ayers will appear at the University of Wyoming on Wednesday after a federal judge ruled he can't be barred from speaking on campus.</T1>

<T1.1>U.S. District Judge William Downes ordered Tuesday that the university must take "all prudent steps" to guarantee Ayers' security at his lecture.</T1.1>

<T1.2>The university had argued that "serious threats" prompted it to cancel the appearance by Ayers, who is now a University of Illinois education professor.</T1.2>
<T1.2.1>Downes' two-page order requires university officials to take "all prudent steps to maintain order and provide for the security of participants and spectators."</T1.2.1>
<T1.2.2>University officials won't appeal the order, said spokeswoman Jessica Lowell.</T1.2.2>
<T1.2.3>University President Tom Buchanan said the school "will do everything in our power to provide a safe and secure environment for his visit."</T1.2.3>

<T1.3>Ayers became a footnote to the 2008 presidential campaign because of his history of violent opposition to the Vietnam War and his acquaintance with then-candidate Barack Obama.</T1.3>
<T1.3.1>Some prominent Republicans suggested that Ayers was a shadowy influence on Obama during his 2008 presidential bid.</T1.3.1>
<T1.3.2>GOP presidential candidate John McCain urged Obama to "come clean" about his relationship with Ayers and vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin accused Obama of "palling around with terrorists."</T1.3.2>

<T1.4>Ayers was a leader of the Weather Underground, a radical anti-war group that claimed responsibility for bomb attacks on the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon and about 20 other targets.</T1.4>
<T1.4.1>No one died in those attacks, though three Weather Underground members blew themselves up building another bomb in 1970.</T1.4.1>
