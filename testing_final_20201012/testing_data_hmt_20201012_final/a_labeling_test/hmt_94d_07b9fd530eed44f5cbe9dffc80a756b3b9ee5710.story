<T1>Rason, North Korea (CNN) -- As the sole Western journalist covering a unique bicycle race in North Korea last month, I was provided with a personal guide, a car with a driver and the promise that I was free to take any photographs I wanted.</T1>

<T1.1>At the border, before going back to China, a group of security guards confiscated my camera and erased all images they thought were inappropriate, or did not portray the country in a favorable light.</T1.1>

<T1.2>But with the help of a computer expert in Hong Kong, I managed to get all the pictures back.</T1.2>

<T1.3>Officially, I only had two restrictions to obey during my trip: No photos of the military or military facilities and all shots of portraits of Kim Il Sung and his son Kim Jong-Il had to show their entire figures.</T1.3>

<T1.4>My guide said they were erasing "inappropriate" pictures, with no further explanation.</T1.4>

<T1.4.1>In total, 90 images were erased from the memory card.</T1.4.1>

<T1.4.2>Some were of angry looking security guards with scruffy barracks in the background, others of government officials going through our passports.</T1.4.2>

<T1.4.3>But others were in my eyes harmless, even scenic.</T1.4.3>

<T1.4.4>There was an old couple walking alongside the cornfields, a family out in the countryside waving from their house, and a mother cycling with her sleeping baby on a seat on the back of her bike.</T1.4.4>
