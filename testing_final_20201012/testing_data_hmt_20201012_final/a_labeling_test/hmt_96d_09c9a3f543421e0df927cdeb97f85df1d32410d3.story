<T1.1>The Taliban had the man cornered and outnumbered.</T1.1>

<T1.2>"He had tremendous magnetism," says Junger, a noted journalist and author who has written bestsellers like "The Perfect Storm," and "A Death in Belmont."</T1.2>

<T1.2.1>The man Junger met was Ahmad Shah Massoud, the "Lion of Panjshir."</T1.2.1>

<1.3>Today, Massoud is a national hero in Afghanistan, but he's also become something else: the prototype for the tough but enlightened leader Afghanistan desperately needs today, some Afghans say.</T1.3>

<T1.4>Though he died eight years ago, his legacy looms over any would-be leader in Afghanistan, Afghans and scholars say.</T1.4>

<t1.5>Massoud had a reputation as a fierce nationalist who would not allow any outside group -- the Russians, Pakistan, the Taliban, even the United States -- to control Afghanistan, says Zieba Shorish-Shamley, an Afghan native and founder of the Women's Alliance for Peace and Human Rights in Afghanistan.</T1.5>

<1.6>Shorish-Shamley, the women's rights activist, says Massoud was assassinated just before the 9/11 attacks because bin Laden feared Massoud.</T1.6>

<T1.6.1>Massoud's military prowess combined with his knowledge of the Afghan-Pakistan border would have made him an even more formidable threat against the Taliban with U.S. military muscle backing him.</T1.6.1>

<T1.7>Yet there are others who say Massoud wasn't that different from the warlords who try to control Afghanistan today.</T1.7>

<T1.8>A year after Massoud's death, he was named a "National Hero of Afghanistan."</T1.8>
