<T1>(CNN) -- Here are reactions to the posting on WikiLeaks.org of tens of thousands of leaked U.S. military and diplomatic reports on the war in Afghanistan:</T1>

<T1.1>"The Afghan government is shocked with the report that has opened the reality of the Afghan war," said Siamak Herawi, a government spokesman.</T1.1>

<T1.1.1>Herawi focused on the allegation that Pakistan was secretly supporting al Qaeda and asserted that Washington needs to deal with the Pakistani intelligence agency, known as the ISI.</T1.1.1>

<1.2>In a statement, Pakistan's foreign office said Monday that the documents are "misplaced, skewed and contrary to the factual position on the ground."</T1.2>

<T1.2.1>"The people of Pakistan and its security forces, including the ISI, have rendered enormous sacrifices against militancy and terrorism.</T1.2.1>

<T1.2.2>Our contributions have been acknowledged by the international community, in particular by the United States.</T1.2.2>

<T1.3>Levin, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he had "strongly urged the Pakistanis to take forceful action against militant networks using Pakistan as a base to attack Afghanistan and our troops."</T1.3>

<1.3.1>But he said Obama's new strategy "has yielded some tangible improvements in preparing Afghanistan to take responsibility for its own security."</T1.3.1>

<T1.4>White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs called the documents' release "a breach of federal law" and said that an investigation into the source of the leak was initiated before late last week.</T1.4>

<T1.4.1>Asked about the leak, he said, "There is no doubt that this is a concerning development in operational security."</T1.4.1>

<T1.5>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Monday that the release would not affect a $33 billion war supplemental vote, to be held this week.</T1.5>

<T1.6>UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said: "I have not seen those [reports] in detail, but they should not be damaging the international efforts.</T1.6>
