<T1.1>Washington (CNN) -- If California's Kevin McCarthy ascends as expected to the No.</T1.1>

<T1>2 Republican leadership position in the House, one thing is assured: He will be dogged by the ever-present political specter of immigration reform.</T1>

<T1.2>McCarthy's backers are hastily shoring up support for his candidacy as majority leader, but so are immigration reform advocates who want to make clear to him their expectations for action.</T1.2>
<T1.2.1>Such is the thorny predicament for the politically savvy lawmaker viewed as most likely to succeed Eric Cantor as majority leader.</T1.2.1>


<T1.3>McCarthy's own rapid rise is the stuff of a political soap opera.</T1.3>
<T1.3.1>He is the boy from Bakersfield who married his high school sweetheart and plunked down money he won in a lottery to start a deli.</T1.3.1>
<T1.3.2>He used those earnings to go to college before entering politics.</T1.3.2>
<T1.3.3>"He has the foresight to know when to push and when not to push and he understands when's the right time to get something done."</T1.3.3>

<T1.4.1>McCarthy became the party whip soon after the Republican takeover of the House.</T1.4.1>
<T1.4>McCarthy's affability has been key to helping soothe ruffled feathers, friends say.</T1.4>

<T1.5>Fellow California Rep. David Valadao counts McCarthy as "both a close friend and a respected colleague," and he's gotten a chance to see the would-be majority leader up close as they and others in the delegation worked together on issues of providing water to their Central Valley region as well as infrastructure needs, he told CNN in a statement.</T1.5>
<T1.5.1>McCarthy often orders takeout and invites House members to his office to eat and talk about issues affecting their districts, their spouses and children, Denham said.</T1.5.1>

<T1.6>Friends say McCarthy, 49, will need that personal touch for crafting relationships and a sense of timing on hot button issues, should he be elected leader next Thursday.</T1.6>
<T1.6.1>That's because fallout from tackling immigration reform could prove politically perilous if Cantor, who has endorsed McCarthy, is any indication.</T1.6.1>
<T1.6.2>That, analysts say, was crucial to his victory in the reliably conservative Richmond-area district.</T1.6.2>

<T1.7>McCarthy's home turf is California's 23rd congressional district, a Republican stronghold ripe with lush farmland in the shadow of mountain ranges.</T1.7>
<T1.7.1>It is also a place that is 35% Latino and where the local business community has made clear that it depends heavily on immigrant labor to pick such crops as grapes, oranges and tomatoes.</T1.7.1>
