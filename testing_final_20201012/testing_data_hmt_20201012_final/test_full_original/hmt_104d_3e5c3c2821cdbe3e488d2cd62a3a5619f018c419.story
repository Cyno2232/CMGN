Los Angeles (CNN) -- Comic actor Dick Van Dyke and his wife escaped unhurt when their car caught fire on a Los Angeles-area highway, California state police said Monday.

Good Samaritans helped the 87-year-old Van Dyke and his wife, Arlene, from his Jaguar after he pulled the car over to the side of the Ventura Freeway in Calabasas, California Highway Patrol spokesman Saul Gomez said. The fire occurred about 2 p.m. Monday, Gomez said.

Arlene Van Dyke posted video online of the burned-out car and the actor talking with police. Publicist Bob Palmer said Van Dyke was "fine" but "slightly embarrassed" and was "appreciative of the instant help he got on the road."
