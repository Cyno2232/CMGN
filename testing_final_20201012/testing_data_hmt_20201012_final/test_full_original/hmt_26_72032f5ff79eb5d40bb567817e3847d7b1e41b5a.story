(CNN) -- Paul Walker's mother has dropped her court bid to take guardianship of the late actor's daughter, a lawyer for Cheryl Ann Walker said Thursday.

Cheryl Walker filed for guardianship of 15-year-old Meadow Walker in March, claiming that Meadow's mother, Rebecca Soteros, has a "drinking problem."

Attorney Steven Bledsoe said Cheryl Walker has filed papers that requested her guardianship petition be dismissed.

The document says Cheryl Walker has told a investigator for the court why she wanted to drop the case but would further explain at a scheduled court date April 30, if necessary.

Meadow Walker, 15, stands to inherit an estimated $16 million from her father's estate.

Walker died in a fiery car crash in Los Angeles during a break in filming "Fast & Furious 7" in November.
