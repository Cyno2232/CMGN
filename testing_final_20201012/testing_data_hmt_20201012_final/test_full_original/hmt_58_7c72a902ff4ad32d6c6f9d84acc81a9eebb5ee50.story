(CNN) -- The mother of Thalia, an internationally known Latin American singer and actress, has died, Thalia posted Friday on her Twitter account.

"Today, half of my soul has died," Thalia said about the death of her mother, Yolanda Miranda Mange. "I feel that I'm dying slowly. ... Thanks for your prayers for my warrior, for my mother."

Thalia Sodi, 39, is a widely popular performer in Mexico and throughout the Americas.

Her mother's death occurred just two weeks before she is to give birth to her second child and one day before Thalia's sister, Ernestina, is to marry Mauricio Camps, Mexico's state-run Notimex news agency said.

CNN's Michael Martinez contributed to this report.
