(CNN) -- Juventus coach Antonio Conte will be free to take his place on the bench for the Serie A champions in December after a 10-month ban for his involvement in a match fixing scandal was cut to four months Friday.

A statement by the Italian Olympic Committee (CONI) confirmed that the 43-year-old can return on December 9.

Conte had taken his appeal to CONI after being handed his original ban by the Italian Football Federation.

The disciplinary action related to his time in charge of Siena in the 2010-11 season.

He was accused of not passing on knowledge of match fixing in games they played while in Serie B.

Conte's assistant at Siena and Juventus, Angelo Alessio, has had his ban for his role in the affair reduced from eight months to six.

The punishments were handed out as part of the 'Calcioscommesse' scandal, which has seen more than 20 Italian teams under the spotlight.

Juventus president Andrea Agnelli welcomed the decision on the club's official website.

"I maintain my view, which is shared by everyone at Juventus, that Antonio Conte is an innocent man and in no way guilty of the charges leveled at him," said Agnelli.

Conte's case was heard by the National Court of Arbitration for Sport (TNAS) and while reducing his ban, did not fully exonerate him of the charges against him.

Agnelli is angry that Conte was not cleared and added: "The confirmation of his suspension is an injustice which should prompt the entire footballing system to ask itself questions," he added.

Conte, who took Juve to the title in his first season in charge, will have missed 15 Serie A matches and the entire Champions League group stage before his ban ends.

But in his absence, Juventus have continued their fine form, topping the Italian standings on the same points as Napoli.
